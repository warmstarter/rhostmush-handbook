This is some examples of what I've been wokring on with RhostMUSH documentation.

requirements.txt can be used to build your own pything environment if you want to try this out yourself.

source/

Includes the source files that are processed. Mostly these are from the RhostMUSH git repository or git wiki. I have not really gotten to the point of editting them yet, just light formatting. This is is not the final form, just an easy way for me to have all documentation in place. You will notice there are redundancies in the documentation and I hope to clear that up eventually. The order of the documntation starts with one of the longer README intros broken into parts and then continues from there.

build/

These are examples of the different formats this documentation can be built into. I'd personaly recommend simply pointing a web browser at the html/ directory, or possibly just starting a temporary python program to serve that directory locally (this is a one liner.) I also built singlepage html, pdf, epub, etc.. formats, but haven't looked into them yet.

There's a lot that can be done here and my hope is to also make this in a way that makes it equally easy to do these advanced features or to have them as plain text in the distro.

Writing a parser/builder to handle MUSH helpfiles is a distant dream, but if it gets to that point, theere's going to be some pretty amazing possibilities.
