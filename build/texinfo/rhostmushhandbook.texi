The RhostMUSH source tree offers many abilities and options
not normally found in any other flavor of mush.  This doesn’t
make it better than other servers (though we think so @emph{j/k})
but it does give you a wider selection of configurability,
which, as you know, is the best part of setting up a mush.
(yea, right)

@subsection Software Requirements


RhostMUSH is a Linux or Unix based server software that runs as a daemon on the host.
In order to build this software, you will need the bare minimum of the ability to run ‘make’ commands.

Package requirements are as follows:


@itemize *

@item 
bash/ksh/dash (or compatible shell - for use with build menu)

@item 
glibc and gcc/clang (compiling the code)

@item 
git (to clone the source and maintain patches)

@item 
libcrypt (for password encryption - this is usually standard on unix based systems)
@end itemize

@menu
* Optional Packages:: 

@end menu

@node Optional Packages,,,Software Requirements
@anchor{install optional-packages}@anchor{b}
@subsubsection Optional Packages


RhostMUSH also offers optional linking and library attachments.
For some of these libraries it will attempt to do auto-detection,
but in a worse case scenario, there exists override hashes in the menu to disable options it thinks exist that do not.

Optional packages are as follows:


@itemize *

@item 
libpcre (if you wish to use system pcre libraries instead of the built-in ones)

@item 
mysql client & mysql_config (required for mysql capabilities)

@item 
openssl dev libraries/headers (for MUX password compatibility, and digest() and advanced cryptology functionality.

@item 
ruby/perl/python/etc (for custom interactive dynamic custom functions with the execscript() feature)

@item 
sqlite3 libraries (required for sqlite capabilities)
@end itemize

@node Hosting Requirements,,Software Requirements,RhostMUSH Requirements
@anchor{install hosting-requirements}@anchor{c}@anchor{install id5}@anchor{d}
@subsection Hosting Requirements



@itemize *

@item 
You will need a stable host and access to open a single port number of your choice on the firewall.

@item 
Most games choose a number between 1025 and 9999, by convention.

@item 
Please make sure your debug_id matches the port number + 5.


@itemize -

@item 
So if your port is 4201, your debug_id will be 42015.

@item 
The debug_id is for use in the API daemon that runs Rhost as a container to keep track of heap, stack, and execution location.

@section Obtaining RhostMUSH Source Code


The only official source for obtaining RhostMUSH is through the ‘RhostMUSH’
github account. If the source code was obtained in some other manner, there
are potentially any number of unintentional or intentional issues that you
might run into.

The recommended method of obtaing RhostMUSH is to clone it’s git reposistory:

@example
git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost
@end example

It is possible, but not recommended to download RhostMUSH via a web browser:

@example
https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk/archive/master.zip
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
This documentation generally assumes that you obtained the RhostMUSH source
code by cloning it’s git repository or at the very least downloading an
archive of the source code from the GitHub website.

It also assumes that the base directory from which all commands are run
and all files are looked for is that git repo’s @code{Server/} directory,
unless specifically noted otherwise.

@section Options for making a MUSH


There is a @emph{lot} of options once your start making your MUSH, but there are
also a few big choices right as you get started making a MUSH. No matter which
choices you ultimately make, there are certain things you will need to know how
to do. This chapter is going to walk you through making the simplest possible
version of RhostMUSH. It’s going to show you the things you would have to do
no matter which choices you were making.

In the process of making that simplest possible RhostMUSH you’ll also learn
what the basics of those choices are and when and how you would make them.
Later chapters will get much more into all of those choices, but they will also
assume you know everything in this chapter already, or at least have it as a
handy point of reference.

While there are lots of little options, there are three big areas where you
make those choices.

* Configuration file options:: 
* Starting database options:: 
* The Choices We Make:: 

@end menu

@node Compile time options,Configuration file options,,Options for making a MUSH
@anchor{install compile-time-options}@anchor{11}
@subsection Compile time options


One of the first steps of making a MUSH or really any computer program is
to compile the source code. This takes what’s basically text files full of code
and turns them into a program you can run. Within that source code are a
number of options to choose from, but any time you want to change one of them,
you have to recompile the source code and then restart the MUSH.

These choices are typically made through the @code{confsource} menu which you’ll
be seeing momentarily. There are some pretty big choices here from whether or
not you want hardcoded +help and comsys, deciding between a more secure server
and certtain powerful but potentially dangerous MUSHcode options, and then
whether or not you want to be able to connect to a variety of external programs
like databases, webservers, and even other programming languages.

@node Configuration file options,Starting database options,Compile time options,Options for making a MUSH
@anchor{install configuration-file-options}@anchor{12}
@subsection Configuration file options


While there are some options in RhostMUSH that can only be changed through
recompiling the source code, there are way more options that can be changed
without having to recompile. These choices are mostly made through the
@code{netrhost.conf} file. Whenever a MUSH starts up or gets rebooted, it’s
going to look to what’s in that file. A few of those choices relate to
further configuring the choices you made with @code{confsource}

The @code{netrhost.conf} file has some aesthetic options like what if anything
it says when the database is being saved or whether or not your MUSH will
allow ANSI color, both in general, but also in things like people’s names.
It has a lot of very esoteric options for tuning the performance and safety
of your MUSH. It also is where you define things that connect to your database
like your master room and guests. It let’s you determine which powers your
staff does or does not have, and it’s also where you have an option to change
the password for #1 should you forget it. There are ways to change some of
these options from within the MUSH and even have those changes become new
defaults that survive a reboot. One thing you set there that you definitely
can’t change from within the MUSH, is which port it runs on.

@node Starting database options,The Choices We Make,Configuration file options,Options for making a MUSH
@anchor{install starting-database-options}@anchor{13}
@subsection Starting database options


This last big choice is one that you probably are well aware of at least some
of the things it allows for, mostly because the database is basically where
everyone on a MUSH lives. Most of the choices you ever make about your MUSH
will happen in the database and it’s something that’s basically always going
to be changing in more ways than any one person could follow. No matter how
vast the database of a MUSH gets, they all started somewhere, and that’s the
last big choice you have to make.

Depending on how you look at it, there’s somewhere between thousands of choices
and two choices for a starting database. What I mean is that you have the
choice of starting with a brand new database to populate, only a room (#0) and
you (#1), even the Master Room is something you’d have to add to it. The other
option is to import an existing database, though to choose that option you’d
also have to have access to an existing database.

Besides the brand new database that can be made on-demand, RhostMUSH comes with
two databases that you can use to get your start. One is called ‘Minimal’ and
the other is called ‘Ambrosia’ after the lead RhostMUSH developed that made it.
Despite the name, they’re both fairly minimal, there’s no grid in either, but
what you get is a lot of pre-installed softcode and security, as well as a
@code{netrhost.conf`} file that has been tuned to work well with it. Even if you
don’t use those databases you can take ideas for the @code{netrhost.conf} file for
tuning your MUSH or even use some RhostMUSH commands to import that softcode
into your database.

@node The Choices We Make,,Starting database options,Options for making a MUSH
@anchor{install the-choices-we-make}@anchor{14}
@subsection The Choices We Make


Well, not you’re aware of those three big choices, what they are, and where
you’ll run across them. Later in this Handbook we’ll be going through those
choices in-depth. In this chapter, what we’ll be doing is using the default
options for for @code{confsource} and @code{netrhost.conf} and a brand new database.
Those options and that blank slate are necessary so that you have in front of
you a working MUSH with only #0 and #1 and get shown the way of building it
into whatever is your dream MUSH, and I know we all have one.

There will be a chance to make all those other choices later, in fact that
will be happening very soon. There’s a lot of very interesting choices that
you can make with RhostMUSH, too many for anyone to ever be able to use them
all. If you don’t start with mastering the basics, you’ll never end up knowing
what are the most RhostMUSH options. I can’t tell you what they are, it’s truly
something you have to discover on your own. Remember, you want to build your
dream MUSH, not mine.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Unless you are intending to start with a brand new database, you must be
aware of it’s needs and expectations for the settings of @code{confsource} and
@code{netrhost.conf} Starter databases tend to distribute with them config
files of at least the options they expect set or not set during the process
of configuring and compiling the server.

Knowing which database you intend to use is the first choice made of these
initial major configuration options, but that last that is made part of the
MUSH.

@node Setup directory permissions,Compile the source code,,Compiling RhostMush
@anchor{install setup-directory-permissions}@anchor{17}
@subsection Setup directory permissions


In order to both compile and run, all of the RhostMUSH files and directories
need to have the proper permissions set. If you obtained the source code
directly from GitHub, it is likely that this step is not required, but there
is no harm in running it anyway:

@example
./dirsetup.sh
@end example

If you did NOT obtain the source code directly from GitHub, it is possible that
even the above script will fail to run with ‘permission denied’ or similar
errors. It is recommended that you obtain the source code from there, but if
for whatever reason this is not an option, manually adjust your permissions
and then re-run the automated permission script:

@example
chmod +rx bin/*.sh src/*.sh game/*.sh game/Startmush game/db_*
./dirsetup.sh
@end example

@node Compile the source code,,Setup directory permissions,Compiling RhostMush
@anchor{install compile-the-source-code}@anchor{18}
@subsection Compile the source code


Once the source code has been obtained and the proper file and directory
permissions have been set, the RhostMUSH source code is ready to be compiled.
This is typically done through an interactive program where you configure the
options you want to have available to your installation:

@example
make confsource
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
It is recommended that if you are just starting out with RhostMUSH that you
compile for the first time using the default compile options which have
specifically been tuned to be closest to what the average person would need
or expect. Changing these options before you have a grood grasp of what
they mean and how RhostMUSH works on a deeper level can potentially cause
security issues, reduce compatibility with softcode rom other types of MUSH
servers, as well as waste system resources.

@code{make confsource} will remember the most recent options you used to compile
the source code for the next time you use @code{make confsource} It might still
be a good idea to more permanently save the options you used to attempt to
compile. However, you still might want to have these options saved more
permanently, just in case. At the @code{make confsource} menu there is an
option to save your current settings to a file. If you choose to do this,
you will find the the save file in the @code{bin/} directory.

@subsubsection Troubleshooting compile errors


Should this result in an error, a script has been included to correct the most
common errors, after which you can once more try to compile:

@example
./bin/script_setup.sh
make confsource
@end example

Once the compile process successfully complete, you should be able to start-up
your new RhostMUSH server. If it complains about missing binaries make sure
they are linked. The provided script will fix this issue, and is not harmful
to run in any situation:

@example
make links
@end example

@node Recompiling the source code,,Troubleshooting compile errors,Compile the source code
@anchor{install recompiling-the-source-code}@anchor{1b}
@subsubsection Recompiling the source code


If you plan to use @code{make confsource} to recompile your source, you should
first issue a @code{make clean} before re-issuing a @code{make confsource}

A failure to issue @code{make clean} prior to re-compiling with @code{make confsource}
can potentially leave stale object files which may cause unforseen issues when
running code, including but not limited to random crashes.  Generally whenever
recompiling it’s good to always make clean first.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
You may also issue @code{make source} if the @code{Makefile} is already defined how
you want it to be.  Please remember to @code{make clean} before @code{make source`}
whenever you alter the code or import new source code.

@subsection Persistent configurable game options


Upon compiling a RhostMUSH server, if it doesn’t already exist, a
@code{netrhost.conf} is copied into the @code{game/} directory for your game. It
includes useful defaults for most compile-time options that will work well for
most games, particularly ones using both the default @code{confsource} options and
related database.

This configuration is derived from @code{defaults/game/netrhost.conf.default}

While this @code{netrhost.conf} is very well documented and quite easy to change
in some places, but there are also some rather technical options that you it’s
important to know the full implications of this.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
The default @code{netrhost.conf} starts the game running on the port @emph{4021} of
the server. If this is your time creating a MUSH, it is recommended that this
setting is the only one that you potentially change, and only if there is a
good reason to. Ports below 1024 are priviliged ports and can not be used for
this purpose.

Once done, you start up the system with the following command:

It will prompt you to start a new db if it doesn’t find one.

You may also do the commands individually:

Once started, log in the #1 character (Wizard) with it’s appropiate
password (no, not ‘potrzebie’, but ‘Nyctasia’).  There were private
reasons for the password change.

Once in, do a @@shutdown to save the database.  Then you can run Startup
normally.   You may make a backup of your database at anytime on-line by
utilizing the @@dump/flat option.  A script comes with this distribution
that allows the ability of auto-archiving your database for a configurable
number of backups.

The main parts of making your RhostMUSH, easy pleasy:


@enumerate 

@item 
The stunnel directory contains TLS/SSL connectivity.  This has to be linked to another port and will tunnel to the mush port.  The README file explains how to set up and configure your TLS/SSL connection.

@item 
./patch.sh – This makes sure you have the latest code.  If you got this by git clone @indicateurl{https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk} then you can ignore patching.  You can use ./patch.sh at any time to update your code.  It ignores local.c incase you make your own modules.

@item 
make confsource.  Yup, it’s menu driven, nifty eh?


@enumerate 

@item 
Options you may want to select (other than the defaults):

@item 
5  (%c is selected by default, but choose %x as well for MUX/TM3 compat)

@item 
9  (if you want $commands to require the COMMAND flag)

@item 
16 (if you want a wider WHO listing like older versions of MUX)

@item 
22 (if you’re converting a TinyMUSH3 or TinyMUX/MUX2 flatfile)

@item

@subsection Using the prebuilt flatfile


There are pre-loaded flatfile databases you can use at this point.  The netrhost.db.flat
and corrisponding netrhost.conf file will be located in the minimal-DBs/minimal_db directory.

You may auto-load the minimal db and corresponding netrhost.conf file with the command:

@example
./minimal.sh
@end example

This is ran from within the ‘game’ directory.  Once this is ran, you will need
to customize the netrhost.conf file for your purposes.  The port and debug_id must
be changed at the very least.  Keep the debug_id coordinated to the port as described.

@enumerate 

@item 
Make a backup of your existing netrhost.conf file:

@example

@end example

@item 
Copy the netrhost.conf file into your game directory:

@example
cp -f ./minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.conf ./game/netrhost.conf
@end example

@item 
At this point you can modify your netrhost.conf file settings in your game directory.
Using an editor modify the ‘port’ and ‘debug_id’ respectively in your netrhost.conf as state.
The ‘port’ will be the port the mush listens on, the debug_id is for the debug-stack and is
your port with a ‘5’ at the end.  So if your port is 4444, the debug_id is 44445

@item 
Load in the flatfile into the mush (You could do this in the Startmush as well)
Manually:

@example
cd game
@end example

./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new dwF

Start your mush:

@example
./Startmush
@end example

This will load the db that you loaded.

—————OR——-

To do manual configuration (skip if the previous step worked for you) And yes, this is a bit of a pain in the bottom, hopefully you will not need this.

You need the following definitions defined to make this work:


@enumerate 

@item 
TINY_U, USE_SIDEEFFECTS, MUX_INCDEC, ATTR_HACK

@item 
(u()/u2() switched)

@item 
(sideeffects)

@item 
(inc()/xinc() switched)

@item 
(support for _/~ attribs)
@end enumerate

You only need to do this if you received the RhostMUSH src.  If you received a binary, continue on to the next part.

To compile the code, just type ‘make confsource’.  It will prompt you with settings on what you need to do.  If you just want to quickly hand edit the Makefile, it is in the directory src (full path src/Makefile).  Then you may just run ‘make source’, if you so choose to hand-edit the Makefile.

After the compile process is done, type ‘make links’!

RhostMUSH was founded in 1989, originally by Natasha Davis (Nyctasia) and as
a branch from the original release of TinyMUD code.  It was her desire to make
a game that was flexible, with multiple levels of progression and highly
customizeable.  She lost time and interest and passed the game to
Steve Shivers (Seawolf), Mike McDermott (Thorin), and Jace Hoppel (Ashen-Shugar)

Through their work, the stability improved, we fixed it to be multi-platform
and as bug free as we could possibly make it.  We introduced several methods both
in game and in source that allowed consistent memory bounds checking and
various alerts for any mischievous naughtyness in-game or possibilities of any
hacks, patches, or alterations in the code causing leaks or issues.

While not perfect, it has allowed us to have an absolutely outstanding
turn around for any bugs sent our way, which anyone who uses RhostMUSH will
attest to.

Over the years, others have joined the RhostMUSH team, including Ambrosia
(who is the current dev lead), Lensman, Kage (who kindly provided the
UTF8/unicode port), Jeff/Loki, Rook, Noltar, and Odin.

We also have had hundreds of people who have offered (and provided) help,
patches, suggestions, bug fixes, and alternations all on their own and
every single one will have had their name mentioned in the RHOST.CHANGES
file in the readme directory.  It’s far too large to have in the online
help files.

RhostMUSH today provides an amazing tool that allows nearly entire
customization in-game of every single feature available in Rhost without
having the requirement to modify the hardcode.  This includes but is
not limited to:

@quotation

Yup, you guessed it.  RhostMUSH has a windows like recycle bin.
This means the objects you @@nuke and @@destroy become ‘destroyed’
but not recycled until they are @@purged.  If you use the Myrddin
CRON in the Mushcode directory, it by default sets up a job
to purge anything over 30 days old, which should be more than
sufficient for any needs.  The goodness of this?  You can recover
nuked things from any period of time, as long as they were not
@@purged first.

The flexibility to customize RhostMUSH is what is most daunting.
Don’t fret, you don’t need to do it to run RhostMUSH successfully.
In fact, the default configuration is mostly compatible with

wishing to play, of course the sky is the limit of what you want to
do.

Functions and commands can both be overridden with softcode.  To
override a hardcoded command you first set the command ignore.
There are various levels of ignoring so that you could have it
ignored from mortals but have it executed fine for non-mortals.
This allows you to use the actual physical command within a
softcode override.  You may also use @@Hook for altering how
a command works.   Functions are overridden by setting the
function in question ignored, then writing a softcode alternative
that is then executed and fetched appropriately.

the lock is to be evaluated.  This works in the same manner
as an evaluation lock.  To be able to use the USELOCK attribute flag
you must be empowered to do so with the ‘ATRUSE’ @@toggle.  You may
also use the secure_atruselock config parameter to globally enable
this and not require the toggle to be set.

@itemize *

@item 
This is something that should be discussed by you and the staff
of your game.  As a good rule of thumb, only provide the bitlevel
that is required to do the job.  Too much power is always risky.
In essence, each tier of bit can do everything the previous bitlevel
can do, and then additional stuff on top of it.  The highest bitlevel
is #1 itself, being bitlevel 7.  Then immortal, which should be
considered the #1 character in most cases and is bitlevel 6.  Then
the royalty character, which is equal to wizard on penn, mux, or
other codebases.  For most things, this is the bitlevel you want
to assign players.  The exception will likely be game owners or
people who control the master room code.

There’s a bunch of readme files and online wizhelp that goes into
detail of the various bitlevels and what each can do.

DB Size - (20000 default) There is no limit on the number of objects the db can have.  By default it’s soft limited to 20K objects, which can be changed by a netrhost.conf file change.

@quotation


@itemize *

@item 
Global parents are useful when you want to have a global ‘parent’
without actually having a defined @email{'@@parent,‘@@parent}’.  It always will be the
highest tier in a lookup.  The way lookups will go will be:

@example
self->@@parent(s)->@@zone(s)->GlobalParent
@end example

The type of the parent does not have to match the target.

These global parents can be defined either by using a global
generic parent or by using the type.  If a type is specified it
overrides the generic.  The following parameters are used:

@quotation


@itemize -

@item 
global_parent_obj     - The generic global parent (if defined)

@item 
global_parent_room    - The room global parent

@item 
global_parent_exit    - The exit global parent

@item 
global_parent_thing   - The thing global parent

@item 
global_parent_player  - The player global parent
@end itemize
@end quotation

@item 
Global @@parents are different than global parents in that any new
item of similar type that is created is automatically assigned this
physical @@parent.  It’s obviously more limiting since it sets
the literal physical parent defined.

The type of the parent does not have to match the target.

The following parameters are used:

@quotation


@itemize -

@item 
room_parent           - The target that new rooms are @@parented

@item 
exit_parent           - The target that new exits are @@parented

@end itemize

@item 
Global attribute formatting is a method define a wrapper, of sorts,
where attributes like @@desc, @@odesc, @@succ, and anything similar
can be processed through this.  All attributes will be either
&FORMAT<attribute> or &<attribute>FORMAT based on the current
configuration.  Example: &FORMATDESC or &DESCFORMAT localy, or
use the following global objects for global formatting.  Local
formatting has priority.

The type of the parent does not have to match the target.

@section Differences to expect to the end user between PennMUSH, MUX, and RhostMUSH


The largest end user experience will mostly resolve around some look and feel.
The general look and feel of how to set attributes, work with commands and
functions, and getting around a grid will be identical between the mush flavors.
@@nuke and @@destroy will work somewhat differently between the three codebases
and some effort should be looked at on how different it behaves.

@section Comparison of features between RhostMUSH, PennMUSH, and MUX2


There are differences in the initial set up from Rhost to PennMUSH (and MUX2).

A lot of people use PennMUSH and if you are one of them, this may help you.
Some people use MUX2, hopefully this will help you as well.


@table @asis

@item NOTE:  If you plan to use sideeffects, you must set the SIDEFX flag to allow

the target to use it

@item NOTE:  Rhost does support UNICODE/UTF8, but it’s currently not part of the main

branch as of this writing.  Please talk to Kage on the dev site for more
information on when it’ll be released.

@section Organization of help and wizhelp


First, on PennMUSH, help is separated into ‘help’ and ‘wizhelp’.  This can
be confusing. If you want to ‘combine’ them, you may use the following snippit:

$ahelp*:@@pemit %#=[switch([!!words(%0)][match(/search,%0*)],0?,[setq(0,help)][setq(1,0)],11,[setq(0,rest(%0))][setq(1,2)],setq(0,trim(%0)))][setq(a,textfile(help,%q0,%q1))][setq(b,textfile(wizhelp,%q0,%q1))][setq(2,)][ifelse(!strmatch(%qa,No entry*),%qa[setq(2,%r)])][ifelse(!strmatch(%qb,No entry*),%q2%qb[setq(2,%r)])][ifelse(!$r(2),No topics found for ‘%q0’.)]

This will display help from help and wizhelp for any matching topic.  It
should make life easier for you.  This also honors the /search switch.

The comsystem is softcode and included in the readme directory. (comsys).
Just load it in.  The mail wrappers can be gotten from:

@section What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH, TinyMUSH2, TinyMUSH3, or MUX2 to work on Rhost


RhostMUSH, for the most part, will work out of the box with most softcode gotten
from other codebases.  There are, however, exceptions.  Most of these exceptions
will be minor code differences between how ANSI is processed, the variences
of arguments or switches to commands or functions, or required flags.

Most changes will revolve around the ones listed in this document.

named variables for regexp patterns in $commands are not supported.
@@aliases on non-players are not supported.  Frankly I find them redundant.

Anything that uses sideeffects –DIRECTLY– requires this flag.
Sideeffects are like set(), pemit(), and so forth.  list(), while a
side-effect, does not require this flag as it is considered passive and safe.

@subsection Variable exits


@quotation

Rhost handles them slightly different.  You do not link
exits to #-4.  That’s an invalid destination.  I always found it, frankly,
stupid to save any data in the database that was literally invalid.  So,
you link the exit as you normally would, then @@toggle the exit variable.
At that point you use @@exitto like you would any other codebase.

@subsection Zones


@quotation

Zones actually can work near exactly as you would expect them to
work on TinyMUSH, MUX, or Penn.  Either at once or at different times.
We recognize multiple zones, zone masters, zone inheritance, zone
parenting, zone command processing, and the ability to bypass zones
entirely.  There’s a ton of flexbility with this.  However, the syntax
for adding/removing zones is different so the commands will have to be
ported to Rhost.

@subsection @@powers


@quotation

Powers work a bit differently in Rhost and they’re named
differently, which should not be that big a surprise as they’re different
between all the codebases anyway.  The big difference is our powers are
tiered, meaning the can be limited or grown to a given bitlevel and are
not just toggle powers like the other codebases.  We also have @@depower
that is the anti-thesis of @@power

While we have 64 character attribute capabilities like
most other codebases, PennMUSH allows 1024 attribute length attributes.
Why you need one that long boggles the mind, but if you do use attribs
that long you need to make sure they are cut down to the proper length.

@section Loading an existing Database


To load in a previous database, you run the db_load script.

From the game directory you would type:

@example
./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm yourflatfilehere data/netrhost.db.new
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
You may also do: ./Startmush
Then you just follow the prompts to load in your flatfile there.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

If you wish to have #1’s password reset to ‘Nyctasia’ please add this
to the bottom of your netrhost.conf file:

@example
newpass_god 777
@end example

The caveat is that you must not have any netrhost.db* or netrhost.gdbm* files
in your data directory prior to loading it in.  It’ll error out if previous
files exist.  So you will need to move all files that start with netrhost.db*
and all files that start with netrhost.gdbm* to another directory.

Your flatfile tends to be named ‘netrhost.db.flat’ which is in your data
directory.  You can, however, name your flatfile anything you want and have
it in any directory you want.

To make a flatfile in game, you just issue @@dump/flat.  You can specify
a filename after it, otherwise it assumes the name ‘netrhost.db.flat’.

@section Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH


In the ~/Server/convert directory there is a script called ‘doconvert.sh’

This script will convert most flatfiles from existing mush engines to
RhostMUSH.  The exception is PennMUSH 1.8.0 and later.  For this there is a
BETA converter penn18x_converter.tgz.  This is proven to work, most of the time,
with codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not been fully vetted with
the latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies.

To convert a non-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you first
need a valid flatfile of the game you’re wanting to convert.  Please refer
to the documentatation of the mush engine in question (MUX, Penn 1.7, TM2/3)
on how to do this.  Once you have it type::

@example
./doconvert.sh FLATFILETOCONVERT FLATFILEOUTPUT
@end example

In this instance, FLATFILETOCONVERT will be the filename (with full path) to
the flatfile you are wishing to convert.

The FLATFILEOUTPUT is anyfilename you wish to name the RhostMUSH converted
flatfile.  I suggest netrhost_converted.db.flat so you know by the name
what it is.

Follow what it asks for and just let it do its thing.

@node Note about Compiling,,Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH,Database
@anchor{database note-about-compiling}@anchor{ab}
@section Note about Compiling


If you are importing a MUX2 flatfile, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that you select
mux passwords as a compatibility option, or you will NOT BE ABLE to log in
to players as the password will not be recognizeable.

Make sure to keep QDBM selected as it’s a much more stable database engine
that does not have attribute limit restrictions like GDBM does.

If you are converting from a Penn, TinyMUSH, or MUX database, make sure you
drill down into the LBUF section and select, at minimum, 8K lbufs.  You likely
want that anyway as it gives you far more room for attribute content storage.

You can go up to 32K safely.  While 64k is safe and does work, there are issues
with networking and older routers that use a 32K TCP buffer size that can
at times cut off the data as overflow resulting in output to the end-point
players not receiving their data.  So it is strongly recommended not to go
above 32K in lbuffer size.

Go ahead and select 64 char attributes.  It allows you to have 64 characters
for attribute names.  It’s handy to have.

If you wish at this point to set up mysql and/or sqlite, you  may do so.
Yes, you can use them in parallel without any issue.

@itemize *

@item 
isstaff() - Softcoded function that returns ‘1’ if its argument matches
a #dbref in the ‘isstaff’ attribute on the Misc Data object.

@item 
bccheck() - Softcoded function that returns ‘1’ if its argument matches
a #dbref in the ‘bcs’ attribute on the Misc Data object.

@item 
width() - Softcoded function that returns 78 for now. For cross-MU*
compatibility.

@item 
pass() - Softcoded function that takes a number as its parameter, and return
a random string of that length. Perfect for setting random passwords.

@item 
cmdmessage() - Softcoded function that takes two strings as its parameters.
Returns ‘<< STRING1 >> String2’. The <<>> part is highlighted red. Good for
all kinds of messages sent by game commands.

@item 
header() - Highly versatile, and a buffer-saving alternative
to using printf() for centering with ansi borders. HIGHLY recommended to use
instead of printf() for such things.
@end itemize

@example
header(text,width,filler,fillercolor,outerpadding,paddingcolor,
       leftinnerpadding,leftinnercolor,rightinnerpadding,rightinnercolor)
  text - Text to center
  width - Width of the header, defaults to width()
  filler - Character(s) to draw the line with. Default: =
  fillercolor - ansicode to color the line with
  outerpadding - Characters to frame the outer ends of the line with.
  paddingcolor - ansicode to color the outer characters with
  leftinnerpadding - characters to put at the left side of <text>
  leftinnercolor - ansicode to color the leftside characters with
  rightinnerpadding - characters to put at the right side of <text>
  rightinnercolor - ansicode to color the rightside characters with

If the object actually needs to modify a player directly, have
it use a restricted staff Global, or if you absolutely must,
make a BC-Houston-Admin and @@set it Architect. Do not give
normal builders access to it, only @@chown things to it and @@set

code along those lines should get @@chowned to the
bc-admin-councilor.

If you as the MU* Head(s) don’t know Softcode well, or want to
leave anything Code to your Head Coder, also give them optional
access to a maintenance Royalty bit in order to properly code
banning/blacklisting +commands and other rare code that requires
Royalty powers. Again, chown finished code to bc-admin-royalty.

a Royalty bit or doing intricate DB maintenance.

@node Site Admins,Globals,MU* Head s,Bitlevels
@anchor{gettingstarted site-admins}@anchor{db}
@subsubsection Site Admins


They already have more powers than any in-game bit can ever
have ;)

Depending on actual involvement with your game, their abilities
in-game can range from merely being @@powered free_wall for
notifying players of downtimes and/or being @@powered shutdown in
order to shut down the game for maintenance, up to being the
only person with actual access to #1.

@node Globals,,Site Admins,Bitlevels
@anchor{gettingstarted globals}@anchor{dc}
@subsubsection Globals


Handle necessary functionality for adminning through the admin-only globals and
softcode.

The setup I personally suggest is to have ALL staffers be AT MAX Architect-level
for everyday work and communication, with special coders that -really- require
it having Councilor-characters available to log into for maintenance or special
code setup. Technically if everything is done right, the Coder(s) of the game do
not require higher privileges than Architect for the vast majority of things.
Royalty-level code should be a rare exception, if at all necessary. The MU*
Head(s) or site-admin should be the only one having access to #1, Immortals or
perhaps even Royalty. The BC’s, Global Function objects and Function objects at
level Royalty and higher have simply been provided as a if-necessary convenience.

Current objects are only @@chowned to certain bitlevels if it is really required
for them to function. Whenever possible, they have been @@chowned to the mortal
BC-Admin-Mortal. All custom global functions listed above are on the semi-
-mortal Global Functions object. The Master Room and Auxiliary Room have been
@@chowned to BC-Admin-Architect.

The Comsystem and +bboard are owned by BC-Admin-Architect, which means that
higher bitlevels might not be able to use those systems if they hide and set
themselves DARK. This is intentional. The Architect bitlevel is enough to freely
set attributes on players, so these systems did not need anything higher, and
it prioritizes Councilor+ as mere mainenance-duty bitlevels. Even the MU* Head
should log on as an Architect for everyday things.

The Comsystem and BBOARD have been modified to be configurable by Architect and
higher. Both systems have a CANUSE attribute with the according code on them.
Note that if you want both systems to be only configurable by Councilor+, that
instead of @@chowning them to a Councilor after changing those attribute for
Councilor or higher, I suggest to simply @@set the bboard and comsystem core
objects NO_MODIFY instead, keeping them at Architect-power but making them
unmodifyable by Architects.

@node Quota,Functions<2>,Bitlevels,Ambrosia’s Minimal Rhost DB
@anchor{gettingstarted quota}@anchor{dd}
@subsection Quota


I highly recommend the use of the alternative @@quota system. BC-Admin-Mortal
and BC-Admin-Guildmaster both have this @@quota system set up on themselves. Both
of them have a high amount of money for everyday operations. You should not give
them free quota or money.

@node Functions<2>,Compiling,Quota,Ambrosia’s Minimal Rhost DB
@anchor{gettingstarted id1}@anchor{de}
@subsection Functions


I also recommend to setup most global functions with /Privileged even if they
are mortal-powered, to make them work even when players are set NO_CODE and
WANDERER by default.

Enjoy!

Flags are pretty much exactly the same as any other mush.  It’s a flag
that you set or unset on a target which then enables/disables or
alters something that target can do.  There’s help on all the flags
in help and wizhelp.

@node Toggles<2>,@@power,Flags<3>,What FLAGS TOGGLES POWERS DEPOWERS and BITLEVELS mean in RhostMUSH

@section Toggles


Toggles were designed as a single point flag that immediately enables
or disables a set ability or condition, thus a ‘toggle’.  It works
exactly like a flag and was originally designed for two reasons.  To
distinguish from the multi-meaning of a ‘flag’, and because frankly
we ran out of flag space :)

@section @@power


A power is similar to a power on other mushes, but unlike them, our
powers are multi-tier.  This means that they can be customized to
empower something at a given bitlevel.  You may empower something
from guildmaster up to councilor level.  There are some powers
with a power level of N/A meaning they are a toggle power granting
an absolute power level as specified in the help for that power.
This requires the INHERIT flag for non-players to inherit powers,
however, a specific object can be granted a power as well.

This is the anti-thesis of @@power.  Also, depowers do not require
inheritance.  They also have priority over flags, toggles, and
powers.  You can use depower to remove or lower abilities and
control from a target, even a full wizard (royalty) can be
depowered.

also override all locks by default (this can be disabled), and
they have an enhanced wizcloaking ability (which also can be
disabled).  They can also set all the lower bitlevels.

This is a hinderance flag.  This flag is automatically set on new
players that are created (which can be disabled).  This flag stops
the player from creating/destroying any database information.   In
effect it stops them from any type of building type commands.  They
still are allowed to set/unset locks/attributes/etc though without
hinderance.

@section Considerations to locking down restrictions in RhostMUSH


Sometimes, you want to have things run at various privilage levels and do not
want to have things with too much access.  Weither that is online objects or
players you want to block from connecting to your mush.  Here’s things you can
do.

One thing to keep in mind is that RhostMUSH, unlike PennMUSH is not flag
dependant on permission level, it’s ownership based.  While setting a wizard
flag on an object would work, it’s not recommended and it is instead recommended
to chown the object in question to a wizard (like your wizard holder character)
Then the object must be set inherit to actually inherit the wizard.


@table @asis

@item Note: inherit is required to inherit anything from the player.  Flags, powers,

toggles.  The only thing that is inherited automatically is depowers.

@quotation

GUEST    - This is your guest flag, it should only be set on guests
WANDERER - the WANDERER flag is default on new players.  This flag disables all building abilitites of the player.
NO_COMMAND - You can use this to stop a player from being able to connect without worrying about changing their password
FUBAR      - As the flag states, it f*’s them up beind all recognition.  It essentially stops them from doing absolutely anything in the mush but pose and say.  Yes, it even disables the quit command.
SLAVE      - Funny enough, slave allows anything but say and pose.  To ruin a troll’s life, set both FUBAR and SLAVE and sit back and smile.
NO_TEL     - The target can’t teleport or be teleported
NO_MOVE    - The target is locked at their location unable to move at all
NO_WALL    - They do not see any @@wall except a wizard @@wall/no_prefix.  This has the bonus of snuffing db save messages.
NO_POSSESS - Sometimes it’s useful to grant a builder character to multiple players.  The NO_POSSESS flag makes it so that player can not be logged in more than 2 times.
NO_MODIFY  - The target can not be modified (except by immortal/#1)
NO_EXAMINE - The target can not be examined/decompiled (except by immortal/#1)
STOP       - Once a matching $command is found on an object set STOP, it ‘stops’ trying to find other $command matches.
NOSTOP     - If a target that is set STOP is also set NOSTOP, it will check the master room for a command and execute that as well if found.
NO_PESTER  - Stops target from @@pemit or whisper.  You may use @@icmd as well.
NO_OVERRIDE - Useful for immortals.  By default they override all locks, including attribute locks.  This makes it so an immortal’s passing of locks will behave like a mortals NO_USELOCK  - This is like NO_OVERRIDE but only effects uselocks.  You likely want to set this on your immortal and wizard.
NO_ANSINAME - stops a target from having an ansified name
NO_CODE     - lock down advanced coding from a target
SPAMMONITOR - stop a target from issuing more than 60 commands a minute.
FREE        - Stop costing money for day to day processing of commands/building

This little doodad uses MTU checking against packet size which will
detect most methods of proxies.  Sadly, this also has false positives
because some situations require a differentating MTU value such as
briged network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or
similar encapsulated network services.  However, this option has
several settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies
to downright forbidding them.  If you’re being actively attacked,
it may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection.

To setup SSL connectivity, we use the STUNNEL application to tunnel SSL to
the mush.  This acts a bit like a man in the middle but remains controlled
by the game owner which would have access to the end point anyway.

Note: it is assumed you will have already initially set up your netrhost.conf.

@subsubsection Modifying netrhost.conf


To be able to utilize SSL, you first must set your netrhost.conf file with
the relevant information to enable SSL connectiions.  These three config
options must be set to be able to use SSL, however, sconnect_host if
not set will default to ‘localhost 127.0.0.1’.

sconnect_reip 1         – This enables the SSL tunnel layer handler within rhost.
sconnect_cmd XYZZY      – this will set the secret SSL command handshake command to XYZZY.  This is case sensitive and can be up to 31 characters.  Please make sure to only use printable non-whitespace characters.  Ergo: one word
sconnect_host wildcards – This allows wildcarded sites (one or more) to allow to access the sconnect/stunnel handler.  This defaults to ‘localhost’ and ‘127.0.0.1’ so if you have ‘localhost.localdomain’ instead then you must set this to whatever is seen as ‘localhost’ to you.  You can verify this by checking your /etc/hosts file.

Note: the sconnect_host is optional.  If you do not specify it, it will default to two values:  ‘localhost’ and ‘127.0.0.1’.

@subsubsection Running the stunnel setup program


At this point you’re ready to run the stunnel setup program.  So at this point type the following:

This will prompt you through settings.  Most you can select the defaults to.
The SSL port you may need to change based on your administrative requirements.
It will prompt you with whatever you set for your mush name.  If you have not
selected a mush name at this point, you can select the defaults.

You will want to use the config file for warpbubble as this hides the secret.

Be aware that if you have DNS host lookups disabled on your mush, you
MUST have 127.0.0.1 as an entry for your sconnect_host file.

@section Note about Patching


There’s two ways you can look to patch the source.  If you plan to run the
RhostMUSH source from a git repository, then please use the git repo to
constantly update your code.  If you knew enough to want to set up a git repo
then we expect knowledge on how to keep source trees updated in the git repo
to be used the same as any other source distribution.

If, however, you have no idea what a git repo even is, or have no inclination
of using git to manage your RhostMUSH source, or just don’t care one way
or another, then you can use the included patch.sh routine (from under the
Server directory) to patch your source at any time.

From the server directory just type:

@example
./patch.sh
@end example

That will auto-compile your source, auto make all your header files and
essentially keep everything up to date to the latest source.
Once that’s done, all you do from within the game is two commands:

@example
@@reboot (or @@reboot/silent)  -- This will load in the new binary
@@readcache  -- This will read in all the .txt file changes
@end example

@node Daily Backups for RhostMUSH,Signals and why you need them for control,Note about Patching,Maintenance
@anchor{maintenance daily-backups-for-rhostmush}@anchor{116}
@section Daily Backups for RhostMUSH


Make SURE YOU RUN DAILY Backups.  Rhost is very stable, but things outside the mush can damage the game. paranoia is fine, especially when they really are out to get you.  TO make the backups, do the following:

@example
 @@dump/flat      -- This makes a flatfile dump of the main database.  You want to run this daily.
 wmail/unload    -- This makes a flatfile dump of the mail database.  You want to run this daily.
 @@areg/unload    -- Only worry about this if you are using auto-registration emailing.  Few do.
 newsdb/unload   -- Only worry if you use the hardcoded bbs system.  Most don't use it.


Backups are already handled and integrated with a script 'backup_flat.sh'.
If you wish to customize this, feel free.  Again, it is well documented and
just require changing settings at the top of this script.

By default, it does 7 contiguous backups.  You may increase or decrease
this value to any value you want.

It will, by default, backup all your txt/\*.txt files, your netrhost.conf
file, your netrhost.db.flat (mush db) file, your RhostMUSH.dump.\*
(mail db) files, your RhostMUSH.news.\* (internal news/bbs db -- if used),
your RhostMUSH.areg.\* (the autoregistration db -- if used), and any sqlite
database you currently may be using which are OPTIONALLY backed up if you
remove the '#' from before it.

The backup script also will optionally rcp/scp, ftp, or mail any backups
you want to a remote destination.  Be forewarned, the backup files can
potentially get rather large for larger games, even compressed.  The
average size for these files will be 1-5MB.  It could potentially get
over 10-20MB in size for excessively large games, so plan accordingly.

Be aware that the backup system will NOT make successful backups if you
run out of disk space.  This includes actually running out of disk space
or running out of disk quota.  There is a mechanism inside the backup
script to specify an email address that you wish to get alerts from
in these instances.  I recommend using it.

If you make changes to your backup_flat.sh script with an already
active and running mush and wish to just restart the backup procedure
just issue::

   ./backup_restart.sh

This will immediately terminate the mush, dumping a special flatfile called
netrhost.db.TERM and scramming the db in question by force-closing it

a TERM signal is common during a server shutdown, so time is paramount.

Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you kill -9 your mush unless you don’t care for the
database.  The reason is if the mush happens to be saving, in any method, to the
database, especially a QDBM database, you will likely have just corrupted your
database, so pull out a flatfile to recover.

Sadly, this also may occur if the server hosting you takes a nose-dive in the middle
of a db write.  Rhost can recover corruption in-game while up, but if it bombs
in the middle of a write, all bets are off. :)

The makefile will ‘make’ the program that will STOP the mush.
Please tweek ‘autolog.h’ with the proper parameters.

Both of these are intended to be used for automations (automated processes)
like your rc.local file and/or startup scripts when you bring your server up.

This is a port redirector incase you decide to move your mush
to a new site/port.  To use, first, compile the code.  To do
this you would type the following:

@example
cc portmsg.c -o portmsg
@end example

if ‘cc’ is not defined, try the following:

@example
gcc portmsg.c -o portmsg
@end example

Once compiled, you would then modify the file ‘file’ to describe
the mush, what was done, where it’s moved to, then specify the
IP address and the PORT where specified.

To launch the application, you would then type:

@example
./portmsg file <port>
@end example

Where <port> is the port where the mush used to run at.

Q:  How do I put color in these files?
A1: Look at ansi.h and you need to put the literal ASCII codes.  They will look like: ^[[0m (for ANSI_NORMAL).  That’s <ESC>[
A2: You can enable ansi_txtfiles then use %c (or %x/%m) encoding for ansi, however you compiled your Rhost.

Q:  I want to design my own txt files to read in the mush.
A:  Easy.  Design them like help.txt would be set up, mkindx the file, then you can access it via @@dynhelp online.

Q:  Do I have to mkindx these files whenever I make changes?
A:  Only the ones that have ‘& ‘ index. (help.txt, wizhelp.txt, news.txt, etc)

Q:  Do I have to @@readcache in the game whenever I make a change?
A:  Only when you modify any of the files listed in README.TXTFILES.  Not the ones you use with @@dynhelp.

Q:  Can’t I just make code in the mush that then is used for these silly txt files?
A:  Absolutely.  Check ‘wizhelp file_object’.

@section Stack limit and debugging


Rhost uses a stack limit in the debug monitor.

This stack limit is set to a reasonable amount of 1000.
This is defined in the debug.h file in the hdrs directory.

This will directly impact the function_recursion_limit from being
set above 100.  If, for whatever reason, you really must have
a ridiculously high recursion limit, then it is a suggestion to
manually modify the stack limit in debug.h to a higher number.

We have reasonably set it to 10000 without too much issue, but keep
in mind, the overhead is higher for every stack you throw on the
process table.  Higher stack means more memory used.

Also be aware that your shell stack limit directly is affected
to this value.

Type:

@example
ulimit -a
@end example

This will show you your shell stack limits.  Do NOT set the
STACKMAX value higher than your shell’s stack value.

The value in ~/Rhost/Server/hdrs/debug.h is currently set as:

@example
#define STACKMAX 1000
@end example

Feel free to change this to a higher value if you wish.

The caveat.  This effects the debug stack daemon.  Meaning,
the only way for this to be updated is through @@shutdown and
then a fresh ./Startmush.

A @@reboot WILL NOT LOAD IN A NEW DEBUG MONITOR!!!!

You can issue @@list stack to see the current stack ceiling ingame.

@subsection Changes to conf for high-bit CPUs


RhostMUSH automatically detects 64-bit platforms, and should compile
cleanly on these.

In case you are trying to compile Rhost on some other crazy-wide CPUs
such as the PS2, PS3 or other 128 or 256 bit CPUs, you can easily do
so by changing a few lines of code in conf.c.

change:

@example
typedef unsigned int    pmath1;
typedef int             pmath2;
#define ALLIGN1 4
@end example

to:

@example
typedef unsigned long   pmath1;
typedef long            pmath2;
#define ALLIGN1 8
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Replace 8 with the size of your CPU’s long integer. (4 for 32-bit,
8 for 64-bit, 16 for 128-bit, etc etc)
@end quotation
@end cartouche

RhostMUSH has only been tested to work on the AMD64, but there is no
reason to believe the same will not hold true for IA64.

@node Changes to autconf for certain systems,,Changes to conf for high-bit CPUs,Troubleshooting difficulties compiling RhostMUSH
@anchor{troubleshooting changes-to-autconf-for-certain-systems}@anchor{135}
@subsection Changes to autconf for certain systems


You should not have to worry about this, but incase something really
weird occurs, you may need to look into these changes…

The autoconfig.h file needs to have modifications to it by hand.

There are three manual entries:

This one sets how it defines the int to character pointer.  It’s safe
to keep it as ‘unsigned int’ for 32 bit platforms.  For non 32-bit,
define it to  how an int is defined on that system:

@example
typedef unsigned int    pmath1;
@end example

This one sets how it defines the signed int to character pointer.  Same
restrictions apply as above for unsigned int:

@example
typedef int     pmath2;
@end example

This sets the allignment for the given platform.  4 represents a 32 bit
platform.  8 would represent a 64 bit platform, etc.  Change accordingly:

@example
#define ALLIGN1 4
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
Make sure these three entries are defined in your autoconf.h file else
the mush will not compile.

Some account have a limited quota to run in.  If you reached or exceed
your disk quota, you can have a corrupted database.  So always keep
your eye on the size.  quota -s to see a human readable format to see
how much quota you have left.  You want to make sure current in use is
below the ‘grace’ and soft/hard limits shown.  If not, you’re out of
space.

You will need to remove some files before you repair and bring up your
mush again.  Try to keep your quota at least 200 megs free to allow
plenty of wonderful growth space for the mush.

@anchor{troubleshooting verify-you-have-enough-disk-space-system}@anchor{13d}
@subsubsection Verify you have enough disk space.  (system)


The second way you can run out of disk space is by the filesystem itself.
do a df -h . in your ‘game’ directory’.  That is df -h <period>.
This will return how much disk space is being used and how much remains.
If it shows 100% used, you’re out of disk space and the db is corrupt.

At this point, you’re pretty screwed.  You can see if anything exists
in your system to free up some space, but if the filesystem itself
is filled, reach out to the owner of the server and let them know.
It’s a much bigger deal than just your mush if that’s the case.

Until this issue is resolved, you can not repair and bring up your mush.
No disk to run the game.

Ok, at this point you likely had your mush up when the physical server
went down hard.  Weither through an emergency shutdown or a physical
power outage, your db likely was brought down hard during a write,
so it left it in a corrupt state.  These things happen.  This is
why we always strongly request you make daily flatfile dumps.

So, to recover your database.

@subsubsection The good news


If you made backups, or if the server had a normal shutdown, you
likely have a flatfile backup.  You will see a netrhost.db.flat
in either the ‘data’ directory or ‘prevflat’ directory.  That
is your manual flatfile backup.

If the server had a normal shutdown, you will see a file called
netrhost.db.TERMFLAT.  This is a scram-emergency db flatfile.
It attempts to write this at the time of server shutdown to
hopefully keep a clean backup in the case of issues since
it identifies the server is coming down hard.  Make sure
if you plan to use the TERMFLAT as your recovery flatfile
that the very last line shows something like ** END OF DUMP **.
That shows you had a successful backup.

@subsection Manually recovering your mail database


To recover your mail manually, you need to delete your mail databases,
reboot, then reload your mail flatfiles.  If you have no mail flatfiles,
well, you’re going to have to start over with the mail database.  Sorry.

First, go into the ‘game’ subdirectory.  Inside that directory is a ‘data’
directory.

You will be deleting all the files with the following names:

@example
RhostMUSH.mail.*                (like RhostMUSH.mail.dir/RhostMUSH.mail.pag)
RhostMUSH.folder.*              (like RhostMUSH.folder.dir/RhostMUSH.folder.pag)
@end example

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
DO NOT DELETE OTHER NAMED FILES!!!
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Once these files are deleted, you may issue a @@reboot to restart the mush.
This will unlock the mail system and load in a fresh db.

Now, if you have flatfiles of the old mail database, you will see in either
the ‘data’ directory or the ‘prevflat’ directory files that are called:

@example
RhostMUSH.dump.folder
RhostMUSH.dump.mail
@end example

Make sure these two files are in the ‘data’ subdirectory.  Copy them in
if they exist in your ‘prevflat’ directory.

Once they are in the ‘data’ directory, within the mush type: wmail/load

This loads in the flatfile and recover the mail database.

Now, at this point the mail db may not be 100% in-sync with the game db.

So let’s fix it.

wmail/fix   – this will run a fix on the mail db and repair any issues.

wmail/lfix  – this will load the fixed flatfile back into the mush.

At this point you should be good to go.

Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you kill -9 your mush unless you don’t care for the
database.  The reason is if the mush happens to be saving, in any method, to the
database, especially a QDBM database, you will likely have just corrupted your
database, so pull out a flatfile to recover.

Sadly, this also may occur if the server hosting you takes a nose-dive in the middle
of a db write.  Rhost can recover corruption in-game while up, but if it bombs
in the middle of a write, all bets are off. :)

Each object (player, room, exit, thing) has two lists of reality levels.
An Rx list, which describe what it can see and a Tx list, which describe
where it can be seen. Those are bitfields. In order for X to see Y a bitwise
‘and’ is performed between X’s RxLevel and Y’s TxLevel. If the result is not
0, then X sees Y. If the result is 0, as far as X is concerned, Y doesn’t
exist. This affects contents lists, exit lists, look, say, pose, @@emit,
@@verb, connect/disconnect, has arrived/has left messages, exit and object
matching. ‘here’ and ‘me’ match always.

It doesn’t affect @@remit, @@pemit, page, WHO or channels.
By default, all new objects are created with an RxLevel of 1 and TxLevel of
1. Rooms are an exception, created with an RxLevel of 1 and a TxLevel of
0xFFFFFFFF. Those default levels can be changed with configuration
parameters.
An object is always visible to itself, even if its Rx and Tx levels don’t
match. (See examples below)

For every reality level defined, you can define an attribute that serves as
description. If you look at something and match more than one of its
TxLevels, you’ll see all the corresponding descriptions on the target
object. If the object doesn’t have any descriptions for the matching levels,
you’ll see the regular @@desc.

The @@adesc attribute on the target is only triggered if the target can see
the looker in turn. It’s only triggered once, no matter how many descs the
looker sees. The @@odesc is shown only to those people that see /both/ the
looker and the target.

Through extension, @@afail/@@ofail and similar pairs (@@adrop/@@odrop,
@@asucc/@@osucc etc) work in the same way. @@verb commands are similary
affected.

Softcoded commands are only matched on the objects that can see the player.
The player doesn’t have to see the object. This includes commands in the
Master Room.

Exits are treated specially. In order to be able to use an exit name (or to
use the ‘move <exit>’ command) the exit must be visible to the enactor. In
order to pass through the exit, the exit must see the enactor in turn. There
are reasons for this, which will become evident in the examples below.

@node Configuration parameters,Example mush conf,Descriptions,Reality levels
@anchor{advanced configuration-parameters}@anchor{157}
@subsection Configuration parameters


A few configuration parameters have been introduced to deal with the reality
levels:

@example
reality_level <name> <value> [<desc attribute name>]
@end example

This directive can only be used in the config file (not with the @@admin
command) and should be repeated for each reality level you want to define.
It defines a new level named <name> with a bitvalue of <value> and an
optional desc attribute. There is a limit of 8 characters on <name>, a
32-bit value on <value> (basically an unsigned long) and 32 characters on
the attribute name. A maximum of 32 reality levels can be defined:

@example
def_exit_tx <value>
def_exit_rx <value>
def_room_tx <value>
def_room_rx <value>
def_player_rx <value>
def_player_tx <value>
def_thing_rx <value>
def_thing_tx <value>
@end example

These 8 directives define the default reality levels of newly created
objects. They can be set in the config file or with the @@admin command.
Like above, <value> must be a decimal number:

@example
wiz_always_real <0|1>
@end example

If this parameter is set to 1 then wizards (and immortals on Rhost) will see
everything and will be visible to everyone. Their effective Rx and Tx levels
will always be 0xFFFFFFFF. Also settable in the config file and with the
@@admin command.

Compile with -DREALITY_LEVELS compile time option to enable ‘Real’ needs to be ‘1’
This is an example file only to be added to the mush.conf file Format:

@example
reality_level <8 char name> <hex-byte-mask> <optional-desc: DESC default>
@end example

@subsection Commands


Two wiz-only commands are used to set the reality levels of an object:

@example
@@rxlevel <object>=<list>
@@txlevel <object>=<list>
@end example

<list> is a space-separated list of level names that have to be set on the
object. If a level name is prefixed with an exclamation mark (!) that level
will be cleared from the object.

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
Changing the Tx levels of an object might make it invisible to you.
In this case, you can still manipulate it by using his #dbref (or *player
for players).
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@node Functions<3>,Example 1 A simplified Witchcraft setup,Commands,Reality levels
@anchor{advanced functions}@anchor{15a}
@subsection Functions


There are five functions that deal with reality levels:

@example
hasrxlevel(<object>,<level>)
hastxlevel(<object>,<level>)
@end example

These two functions check if an object has the specified Rx or Tx level.
You must control <object>. They return 0 or 1 and #-1 in case the object
does not exist or you don’t have permissions:

@example
rxlevel(<object>)
txlevel(<object>)
@end example

These two functions return a space-separated list of the object’s Rx or Tx
levels. Again, you must control the object:

@example
cansee(<obj1>,<obj2>)
@end example

A wiz-only function, returns 1 of <obj1> can see <obj2> from a reality
levels point of view. It doesn’t check if the objects are in the same
location, the DARK/CLOAKED flags and so on. Just <obj1>’s Rx level against
<obj2>’s Tx level.

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
If you are using it on MUX2.0 with /both/ reality levels and Wod
Realms enabled, the function will perform both checks and the Wod Realms
version checks against the DARK flag.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@subsection Example 1: A simplified Witchcraft setup


In Witchcraft, besides the various Gifted classes, characters can be spirits
There are spirit realms to which the mundane can not travel. Therefore we
will use 2 reality levels: Real and Ghost. Since some spirits can become
solid for a limited period of time, we will also use an additional desc for
the Ghost level, called GHOSTDESC. Therefore in the config file we will
have:

@example
reality_level Real 1
reality_level Ghost 2 GHOSTDESC
@end example

Ghosts can pass through most mundane locks, so the exists should allows the
ghosts to pass:

@example
def_exit_rx 3
@end example

Note that def_exit_tx isn’t set. Why? Because ghosts see the mundane world
anyway, so a spirit character will have:

@example
@@txlevel <player>=!Real Ghost
@@rxlevel <player>=Real Ghost
@end example

Let’s assume 3 players:
John is a Mundane. He won’t see spirits.
John’s Rx: Real
John’s Tx: Real
John’s @@desc: This is John.
John’s &GHOSTDESC: (Not important, since it’s never visible)
Johh’s @@adesc: %N has looked at you.
John’s @@odesc: has looked at John.

Jack is a Gifted. He will sense spirits, but is still made from flesh
and blood so visible to mundanes.
Jack’s Rx: Real Ghost
Jack’s Tx: Real
Jack’s @@desc: This is Jack.
Jack’s &GHOSTDESC: (Not important, since it’s never visible)
Jack’s @@adesc: %N has looked at you.
Jack’s @@odesc: has looked at Jack.

Frank is a ghost. He will see other spirits as well as mundanes, but won’t
be visible to mundanes. He can also become visible to everybody.
Frank’s Rx: Real Ghost
Frank’s Tx: Ghost
Frank’s @@desc: This is Frank, looking human.
Frank’s &GHOSTDESC: This is Frank’s ghostly shape.
Frank’s @@adesc: %N has looked at you.
Frank’s @@odesc: has looked at Frank.

Following are commands that each of the players enter and what they see.
I’ll assume the +materialize command is defined like:
&CMD_MATERIALIZE <cmdobject>=$+materialize:@@txlevel %#=Real; @@pemit %#=You
are now material.

@subsection Example 2: A WoD setup


The reality levels will be defined like this:
reality_level           Real 1
reality_level           Obf1 2
reality_level           Obf2 4
reality_level           Obf3 8 OBFDESC
reality_level           Obf4 16 OBFDESC
reality_level           Obf5 32 OBFDESC
reality_level           Umbra 64 UMBRADESC
reality_level           Fae 128 FAEDESC
reality_level           Shadow 256 SHADOWDESC
reality_level           All 511

5 levels of Obfuscation, Umbra, Dreaming, Wraiths. ‘All’ is a handy
replacement for all levels, useful for wizards and wizobjects that should
be visible on all levels. Also useful when you want to set an object’s
levels to something without knowing what he had before.

@@rxlevel #276=!All Real

!All will clear all levels, then the object will gain the Real level.
There is more than one Obfuscation level because of the relation between
Auspex and Obfuscation.

A vampire with Obfuscate 2, should not be visible by one with Auspex 1.
However one with Auspex 3 should see another vampire with Obfuscate 1, 2
/or/ 3.

Obfuscated players can move if they have Obf > 1. Umbral and Shadow players
should also be able to see most of the exits. So the exits at creation
should have default levels of Real + Obf2 + Obf3 + Obf4 + Obf5 + Umbra +
Shadow = 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 256 = 381:

@example
def_exit_rx 381
def_exit_tx 381
@end example

Obf1 is not included since an Obfuscated vampire should not be able to move
if it only has Obf1. Therefore they won’t see the exits. If you want them
to be able to see the exits, but not to use them, change the default Tx of
the exits:

@example
def_exit_rx 381
def_exit_tx 383
@end example

Joe the Mortal will have an RxLevel: Real and a TxLevel: Real
Jack the Malk, who likes to walk around Obfuscated and has Obfuscate 2 will
have an RxLevel: Real (he sees what the mortals see) but a TxLevel: Obf2
Jimmy the Nossie, who is using the Mask and has Obfuscate 4, but doesn’t
try to make himself invisible will have an RxLevel: Real (as Jack)
and a TxLevel: Real Obf4. He will also set his @@desc to what the mortals see and
&OBFDESC to his real slimy desc. Simply put, he will be visible to mortals,
but not with his real desc.

Aldrin the Gangrel, has Auspex 4 and activates it. Therefore, his TxLevel
will still be Real, but RxLevel: Real Obf1 Obf2 Obf3 Obf4 (all of them). So
he can see Joe, Jack and Jimmy’s both descs.
Joe, on the other hand, won’t see Jack at all. He will still see Jimmy, but
only Jimmy’s @@desc, not the OBFDESC

Frida the Fae… will have RxLevel: Real Fae and TxLevel: Real Fae. @@desc
set to the mundane desc, &FAEDESC set to the Chimerical desc.
Emily the Enchanted will have an RxLevel: Real Fae, but the TxLevel: Real.
No &FAEDESC on her, although she’ll be able to see it the one on Frida.
Gil the Garou, while travelling through the Umbra, will have RxLevel: Umbra
and TxLevel: Umbra. &UMBRADESC is his friend. He won’t see mortals or other
characters who are not in the Umbra.

Barbie the Bastet, who’s only peeking in the Umbra, without going there,
will have RxLevel: Umbra, TxLevel: Real. Dangerous position since she
can’t see the things that see her.

Deanna the Drake, who activates her spirit vision, will have
RxLevel: Real Umbra and TxLevel: Real. She will see characters in Umbra and
real world at the same time and perceive the desc appropiate to the realm
the ohter character is in.

Wanda the Wraith: RxLevel: Real Shadow, TxLevel: Shadow. Her @@desc
would be empty, but the &SHADOWDESC should be set.
Marie the Mortal+ Medium: RxLevel: Real Shadow, TxLevel: Real

Global code objects that all characters should be able to use:
RxLevel: All, TxLevel: All

While MUSHL_VARS are sanitized on what is allowable as a mush variable, this
is not necessarilly sanitized on what the calling script can fetch as a valid
variable.  Of note, you can not set environment variables that contain an
equals sign.  Be aware of this limitation.

Remember, MUSHL_VARS is the environment variable seen by the script.
This is EXECSCRIPT_VARS on the mush itself, that is the attribute set
on the target that contains the execscript() that is being executed.

So entering zones if there are no zones:
-1

Entering zones if it has three zones (#123, #456, and #789)
123
456
789
-1

As you see, the last value of the zone @emph{MUST} be -1.  This tells it
that there are no more zones to add.

You would use the same steps if you plan to move QDBM to GDBM.  I however would
not do this.  Moving from QDBM to GDBM is a huge step backwards.  Seriously,
don’t do it unless you have absolutely no other recourse.

Ok.

So you’re running an old RhostMUSH.

One prior to 3.9.5p2 and want to take advantage of the new
format of the Makefile and the automated mysql stuff and
all the other goodies that isn’t really (easilly) done
with just patch.sh.

Well, you’re in luck.  It is actually fairly easy to do.

This is what you have to do.

First thing’s first.


@enumerate 

@item 
Log into your existing mush.  Let’s make current backups
of all your flatfiles.  Issue:

@example
@@dump/flat
wmail/unload
@@areg/unload
newsdb/unload
@end example

@item 
Shutdown your game:

@example
@@shutdown
@end example

@item 
Make an image of all your current backed up files.  From The Server/game directory you would type:

@example
./backup_flat.sh -s
@end example
@end enumerate

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Please remember the ‘-s’ to the ./backup_flat.sh.
@end quotation
@end cartouche


@enumerate 4

@item 
Make note of the most recently created file in the directory Server/game/oldflat.  It’s usually named something like:

@example
RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz
@end example
@end enumerate

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
You will need this file later.
@end quotation
@end cartouche


@enumerate 5

@item 
Rename your ‘Rhost’ directory to something else.  This is the directory that you have containing the ‘Server’ directory.  Name it anything you want other than ‘Rhost’.  For those not used to unix you would type:

@example
mv Rhost Rhost_old
@end example

@item 
Pull in the latest Rhost.  You would type:

@example
git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost
@end example
@end enumerate

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
You would type this in the same directory you have renamed your old ‘Rhost’ directory
@end quotation
@end cartouche


@enumerate 7

@item 
go into the Rhost/Server directory.   Type:

@example
make confsource
@end example

Select what options you want (including the mysql and other goodies) then compile it (also within the menu, it’s the ‘r’ option).

@item 
Once your game is compiled and ready to go you need to copy in the data from your old game.  Copy the RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz we mentioned in step #4 to the Server/game directory of your NEW GAME DIRECTORY.  From within the ‘game’ directory of your current game you should be able to issue (if you named the old one Rhost_old). Again this needs to be done FROM YOUR Server/game directory!!!
@end enumerate

@quotation


@enumerate A

@item 
cp netrhost.conf netrhost.conf.orig

@item 
cp ../../Rhost_old/Server/game/RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz .

@item 
tar -zxvf RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz

@item 
Compare your current netrhost.conf to the default one that came with the source (that you renamed to netrhost.conf.orig).  Likely the only sections you have to add to your current netrhost.conf (that came with your RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz archive), will be toward the end, with the include rhost_ingame.conf and rhost_mysql.conf.  Depending on how old your game is coming from you may need to add more options.  Any config option that is the same between the netrhost.conf files do not have to be copied over, and you want to keep your custom settings (like don’t port or other stuff you have already customized).

@item 
Load in your flatfile information:

@example
./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm data/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new
@end example

@item 
Your ./Startmush should re-index all your txt files you originally made:

@example
./Startmush
@end example

@item 
In your game type the following as an immortal or as #1.
@end enumerate

@quotation


@enumerate 

@item 
Load in your mail flatfile:

@example
wmail/load
@end example

@item 
Load in your autoregistration flatfile (if available):

@example
@@areg/load
@end example

@item 
Load in your hardcoded bbs flatfile (if available):

@example
newsdb/load
@end example
@end enumerate
@end quotation
@end quotation


@enumerate 9

@item 
You should be good to go on a current directory structure for Rhost.  Enjoy!
@end enumerate

@node Adding MySQL to RhostMUSH older than 3 9 5p2,,Updating RhostMUSH prior to 3 9 5p2,Upgrading a Legacy RhostMUSH Installation
@anchor{legacy adding-mysql-to-rhostmush-older-than-3-9-5p2}@anchor{185}
@section Adding MySQL to RhostMUSH older than 3.9.5p2


MySQL is now native in RhostMUSH as of 3.9.5p2.

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
To autodetect it, YOU MUST HAVE mysql_config installed and running on your server.  Without this, even if you have mysql db installed it won’t be able to recognize the parameters you will need for it and will thus fail.  Please check your linux distribution to see what packages are needed to install mysql_config.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Download the git repository to a seperate directory so that you can
copy over the files that it requires you to.

Suggestion:

@example
git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk ~/tmprho
@end example

If you are patching UP from an older version, you need to update
the following files:


@enumerate 

@item 
update your src/Makefile to the one in the 3.9.5p2+ repo
( cp ~/tmprho/Server/src/Makefile ~/Rhost/Server/src/Makefile )

@item 
update your bin/asksource.* files to the one in the 3.9.5p2+ repo
( cp ~/tmprho/Server/bin/asksource.* ~/Rhost/Server/bin/ )

@item 
append ‘include rhost_mysql.conf’ BEFORE the rhost_ingame.conf file
and before the section that says ‘define local aliases’ toward the end of
your netrhost.conf file.
( edit your ~/Rhost/Server/game/netrhost.conf file )

@item 
copy the game/rhost_mysql.conf file from the 3.9.5p2+ repo
( cp ~/tmprho/Server/game/rhost_mysql.conf ~/Rhost/Server/game/ )

@item 
The following lines have to be REPLACED/CHANGED in local.c ( toward the top ):
( you may edit this or copy the one from the other distro )
( do either:  edit ~/Rhost/Server/src/local.c )
(        or:  cp ~/tmprho/Server/src/local.c ~/Rhost/Server/src/local.c )
@end enumerate

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
IF REPLACING/CHANGING local.c COPY BELOW
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@example
/* Called when the mush starts up, immediatly prior to the main game
 * loop being entered. By this point all databases are loaded and
 * all variables configured.
 */
#ifdef MYSQL_VERSION
   extern void local_mysql_init(void);
   extern int sql_shutdown(dbref player);
#endif

#ifdef SQLITE
   extern void local_sqlite_init(void);
#endif /* SQLITE */

void local_startup(void) @{
#ifdef SQLITE
   local_sqlite_init();
#endif /* SQLITE */
#ifdef MYSQL_VERSION
   local_mysql_init();
#endif
   load_regexp_functions();
@}

/* Called immediatly after the main game loop exits. At this point
 * all databases and variables are still configured
 */
void local_shutdown(void) @{
#ifdef MYSQL_VERSION
   sql_shutdown(-1);
#endif
@}
@end example


@enumerate 6

@item 
Issue ‘make clean’ then make confsource to rebuild using the latest
builder script to build in the mysql changes.

@subsection Changes


lnum() and lnum2() now can handle negative numbers.
@@list options shows if the COMMAND flag is used.
NOMODIFY can be configured to be settable/unsettable/modifiable by imm only.
vector functions (vadd, etc) that return a list now recognize output seps.
MAX_ARGS in ‘externs.h’ may be changed to increase the total number of arguments functions like switch() may take.  MAX_ARGS is currently defaulted to ‘30’ though MUX 2.0 has it set to ‘100’.  This HAS to be a compile time change else possible SIGSEGV’s could happen.
mail/write +editall=old,new - argument to mail/write added. Modifies ALL lines.
mail/write +feditall=old,new - modify ALL matches on ALL lines.
mail/write +fedit #=old,new - modify ALL matches on given line.
mail/write +cc/+bcc=new - if FORWARDING or SENDING (not reply!) will allow the user to redefine who the message is being sent out to.
_ATTR can be compile-time added to be wiz-only settable/modifiable attributes.
Modified mail/write +justify, +insert, +edit, +editall to rehandle line count
Made option to make harder password guessing.
dice() takes ‘1’ for expanded, ‘2’ for expanded w/o totals, and optional output seperator.  Also has optional argument for low-limit Can mimic TM 3.0’s lrand() function.
modified connecting to @@program based on toggle.
added modified/created with ‘examine’ and ‘examine/brief’ and ‘examine thing/*’

@quotation Note 
The Rhost developers would like to see what was added, and possibly
look at adding them to the main distro if we see others would like
it (with full credits to you), but we belive once you have the code,
you should be allowed to play with it fully as long as the first two
rules are kept.
