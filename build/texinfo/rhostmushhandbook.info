The RhostMUSH source tree offers many abilities and options not normally
found in any other flavor of mush.  This doesn’t make it better than
other servers (though we think so `j/k') but it does give you a wider
selection of configurability, which, as you know, is the best part of
setting up a mush.  (yea, right)

   * A high-performance dual-quota system.

   * A complete rewrite of key areas and referbishments of all the other
     areas.

   * An on-line recover tool for accidental db destruction.

   * Multi-wizard architecture for better control of staff.

   * Multi-power system to tweek abilities of players.

   * Multi-zone system where people can belong to multiple zones.

   * Built in error correction for db corruption or other misuse.

   * Built in accounting for those annoying twinks who try to hack.

   * Many new functions and commands not seen anywhere else.

   * A lot more that could drag this document out for pages.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: System Requirements,  Next: Software Requirements,  Up: RhostMUSH Requirements

1.1 System Requirements
=======================

   * Operating System: Unix-like

        - Almost any variant of Unix or Linux should compile cleanly and
          run

        - Preliminary support for Windows with an equivalent development
          environment

   * Memory: 12-100 MB

        - Depending on size of database and buffers, as well as selected
          options

        - 1 GB (memory and swap combined) is the minimum required to
          compile

   * Storage: 100 MB and up

        - Depending on size of database and backup retention policy

     Note: Third-party applications can use considerably more resources


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Software Requirements,  Next: Hosting Requirements,  Prev: System Requirements,  Up: RhostMUSH Requirements

1.2 Software Requirements
=========================

RhostMUSH is a Linux or Unix based server software that runs as a daemon
on the host.  In order to build this software, you will need the bare
minimum of the ability to run ’make’ commands.

Package requirements are as follows:

        * bash/ksh/dash (or compatible shell - for use with build menu)

        * glibc and gcc/clang (compiling the code)

        * git (to clone the source and maintain patches)

        * libcrypt (for password encryption - this is usually standard
          on unix based systems)

* Menu:

* Optional Packages::


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Optional Packages,  Up: Software Requirements

1.2.1 Optional Packages
-----------------------

RhostMUSH also offers optional linking and library attachments.  For
some of these libraries it will attempt to do auto-detection, but in a
worse case scenario, there exists override hashes in the menu to disable
options it thinks exist that do not.

Optional packages are as follows:

        * libpcre (if you wish to use system pcre libraries instead of
          the built-in ones)

        * mysql client & mysql_config (required for mysql capabilities)

        * openssl dev libraries/headers (for MUX password compatibility,
          and digest() and advanced cryptology functionality.

        * ruby/perl/python/etc (for custom interactive dynamic custom
          functions with the execscript() feature)

        * sqlite3 libraries (required for sqlite capabilities)


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Hosting Requirements,  Prev: Software Requirements,  Up: RhostMUSH Requirements

1.3 Hosting Requirements
========================

   * You will need a stable host and access to open a single port number
     of your choice on the firewall.

   * Most games choose a number between 1025 and 9999, by convention.

   * Please make sure your debug_id matches the port number + 5.

        - So if your port is 4201, your debug_id will be 42015.

        - The debug_id is for use in the API daemon that runs Rhost as a
          container to keep track of heap, stack, and execution
          location.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Obtaining RhostMUSH Source Code,  Next: Options for making a MUSH,  Up: Installing RhostMUSH

2.1 Obtaining RhostMUSH Source Code
===================================

The only official source for obtaining RhostMUSH is through the
’RhostMUSH’ github account.  If the source code was obtained in some
other manner, there are potentially any number of unintentional or
intentional issues that you might run into.

The recommended method of obtaing RhostMUSH is to clone it’s git
reposistory:

     git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost

It is possible, but not recommended to download RhostMUSH via a web
browser:

     https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk/archive/master.zip

     Note: This documentation generally assumes that you obtained the
     RhostMUSH source code by cloning it’s git repository or at the very
     least downloading an archive of the source code from the GitHub
     website.

     It also assumes that the base directory from which all commands are
     run and all files are looked for is that git repo’s ‘Server/’
     directory, unless specifically noted otherwise.

2.2 Options for making a MUSH
=============================

There is a `lot' of options once your start making your MUSH, but there
are also a few big choices right as you get started making a MUSH. No
matter which choices you ultimately make, there are certain things you
will need to know how to do.  This chapter is going to walk you through
making the simplest possible version of RhostMUSH. It’s going to show
you the things you would have to do no matter which choices you were
making.

In the process of making that simplest possible RhostMUSH you’ll also
learn what the basics of those choices are and when and how you would
make them.  Later chapters will get much more into all of those choices,
but they will also assume you know everything in this chapter already,
or at least have it as a handy point of reference.

While there are lots of little options, there are three big areas where
you make those choices.

* Compile time options::
* Configuration file options::
* Starting database options::
* The Choices We Make::


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Compile time options,  Next: Configuration file options,  Up: Options for making a MUSH

2.2.1 Compile time options
--------------------------

One of the first steps of making a MUSH or really any computer program
is to compile the source code.  This takes what’s basically text files
full of code and turns them into a program you can run.  Within that
source code are a number of options to choose from, but any time you
want to change one of them, you have to recompile the source code and
then restart the MUSH.

These choices are typically made through the ‘confsource’ menu which
you’ll be seeing momentarily.  There are some pretty big choices here
from whether or not you want hardcoded +help and comsys, deciding
between a more secure server and certtain powerful but potentially
dangerous MUSHcode options, and then whether or not you want to be able
to connect to a variety of external programs like databases, webservers,
and even other programming languages.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Configuration file options,  Next: Starting database options,  Prev: Compile time options,  Up: Options for making a MUSH

2.2.2 Configuration file options
--------------------------------

While there are some options in RhostMUSH that can only be changed
through recompiling the source code, there are way more options that can
be changed without having to recompile.  These choices are mostly made
through the ‘netrhost.conf’ file.  Whenever a MUSH starts up or gets
rebooted, it’s going to look to what’s in that file.  A few of those
choices relate to further configuring the choices you made with
‘confsource’

The ‘netrhost.conf’ file has some aesthetic options like what if
anything it says when the database is being saved or whether or not your
MUSH will allow ANSI color, both in general, but also in things like
people’s names.  It has a lot of very esoteric options for tuning the
performance and safety of your MUSH. It also is where you define things
that connect to your database like your master room and guests.  It
let’s you determine which powers your staff does or does not have, and
it’s also where you have an option to change the password for #1 should
you forget it.  There are ways to change some of these options from
within the MUSH and even have those changes become new defaults that
survive a reboot.  One thing you set there that you definitely can’t
change from within the MUSH, is which port it runs on.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Starting database options,  Next: The Choices We Make,  Prev: Configuration file options,  Up: Options for making a MUSH

2.2.3 Starting database options
-------------------------------

This last big choice is one that you probably are well aware of at least
some of the things it allows for, mostly because the database is
basically where everyone on a MUSH lives.  Most of the choices you ever
make about your MUSH will happen in the database and it’s something
that’s basically always going to be changing in more ways than any one
person could follow.  No matter how vast the database of a MUSH gets,
they all started somewhere, and that’s the last big choice you have to
make.

Depending on how you look at it, there’s somewhere between thousands of
choices and two choices for a starting database.  What I mean is that
you have the choice of starting with a brand new database to populate,
only a room (#0) and you (#1), even the Master Room is something you’d
have to add to it.  The other option is to import an existing database,
though to choose that option you’d also have to have access to an
existing database.

Besides the brand new database that can be made on-demand, RhostMUSH
comes with two databases that you can use to get your start.  One is
called ’Minimal’ and the other is called ’Ambrosia’ after the lead
RhostMUSH developed that made it.  Despite the name, they’re both fairly
minimal, there’s no grid in either, but what you get is a lot of
pre-installed softcode and security, as well as a ‘netrhost.conf`’ file
that has been tuned to work well with it.  Even if you don’t use those
databases you can take ideas for the ‘netrhost.conf’ file for tuning
your MUSH or even use some RhostMUSH commands to import that softcode
into your database.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: The Choices We Make,  Prev: Starting database options,  Up: Options for making a MUSH

2.2.4 The Choices We Make
-------------------------

Well, not you’re aware of those three big choices, what they are, and
where you’ll run across them.  Later in this Handbook we’ll be going
through those choices in-depth.  In this chapter, what we’ll be doing is
using the default options for for ‘confsource’ and ‘netrhost.conf’ and a
brand new database.  Those options and that blank slate are necessary so
that you have in front of you a working MUSH with only #0 and #1 and get
shown the way of building it into whatever is your dream MUSH, and I
know we all have one.

There will be a chance to make all those other choices later, in fact
that will be happening very soon.  There’s a lot of very interesting
choices that you can make with RhostMUSH, too many for anyone to ever be
able to use them all.  If you don’t start with mastering the basics,
you’ll never end up knowing what are the most RhostMUSH options.  I
can’t tell you what they are, it’s truly something you have to discover
on your own.  Remember, you want to build your dream MUSH, not mine.

     Note: Unless you are intending to start with a brand new database,
     you must be aware of it’s needs and expectations for the settings
     of ‘confsource’ and ‘netrhost.conf’ Starter databases tend to
     distribute with them config files of at least the options they
     expect set or not set during the process of configuring and
     compiling the server.

     Knowing which database you intend to use is the first choice made
     of these initial major configuration options, but that last that is
     made part of the MUSH.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Setup directory permissions,  Next: Compile the source code,  Up: Compiling RhostMush

2.3.1 Setup directory permissions
---------------------------------

In order to both compile and run, all of the RhostMUSH files and
directories need to have the proper permissions set.  If you obtained
the source code directly from GitHub, it is likely that this step is not
required, but there is no harm in running it anyway:

     ./dirsetup.sh

If you did NOT obtain the source code directly from GitHub, it is
possible that even the above script will fail to run with ’permission
denied’ or similar errors.  It is recommended that you obtain the source
code from there, but if for whatever reason this is not an option,
manually adjust your permissions and then re-run the automated
permission script:

     chmod +rx bin/*.sh src/*.sh game/*.sh game/Startmush game/db_*
     ./dirsetup.sh


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Compile the source code,  Prev: Setup directory permissions,  Up: Compiling RhostMush

2.3.2 Compile the source code
-----------------------------

Once the source code has been obtained and the proper file and directory
permissions have been set, the RhostMUSH source code is ready to be
compiled.  This is typically done through an interactive program where
you configure the options you want to have available to your
installation:

     make confsource

     Note: It is recommended that if you are just starting out with
     RhostMUSH that you compile for the first time using the default
     compile options which have specifically been tuned to be closest to
     what the average person would need or expect.  Changing these
     options before you have a grood grasp of what they mean and how
     RhostMUSH works on a deeper level can potentially cause security
     issues, reduce compatibility with softcode rom other types of MUSH
     servers, as well as waste system resources.

2.3.2.1 Saving your compile options
...................................

‘make confsource’ will remember the most recent options you used to
compile the source code for the next time you use ‘make confsource’ It
might still be a good idea to more permanently save the options you used
to attempt to compile.  However, you still might want to have these
options saved more permanently, just in case.  At the ‘make confsource’
menu there is an option to save your current settings to a file.  If you
choose to do this, you will find the the save file in the ‘bin/’
directory.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Troubleshooting compile errors,  Next: Recompiling the source code,  Prev: Saving your compile options,  Up: Compile the source code

2.3.2.2 Troubleshooting compile errors
......................................

Should this result in an error, a script has been included to correct
the most common errors, after which you can once more try to compile:

     ./bin/script_setup.sh
     make confsource

Once the compile process successfully complete, you should be able to
start-up your new RhostMUSH server.  If it complains about missing
binaries make sure they are linked.  The provided script will fix this
issue, and is not harmful to run in any situation:

     make links


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Recompiling the source code,  Prev: Troubleshooting compile errors,  Up: Compile the source code

2.3.2.3 Recompiling the source code
...................................

If you plan to use ‘make confsource’ to recompile your source, you
should first issue a ‘make clean’ before re-issuing a ‘make confsource’

A failure to issue ‘make clean’ prior to re-compiling with ‘make
confsource’ can potentially leave stale object files which may cause
unforseen issues when running code, including but not limited to random
crashes.  Generally whenever recompiling it’s good to always make clean
first.

     Note: You may also issue ‘make source’ if the ‘Makefile’ is already
     defined how you want it to be.  Please remember to ‘make clean’
     before ‘make source`’ whenever you alter the code or import new
     source code.

2.4.1 Persistent configurable game options
------------------------------------------

Upon compiling a RhostMUSH server, if it doesn’t already exist, a
‘netrhost.conf’ is copied into the ‘game/’ directory for your game.  It
includes useful defaults for most compile-time options that will work
well for most games, particularly ones using both the default
‘confsource’ options and related database.

This configuration is derived from ‘defaults/game/netrhost.conf.default’

While this ‘netrhost.conf’ is very well documented and quite easy to
change in some places, but there are also some rather technical options
that you it’s important to know the full implications of this.

     Note: The default ‘netrhost.conf’ starts the game running on the
     port `4021' of the server.  If this is your time creating a MUSH,
     it is recommended that this setting is the only one that you
     potentially change, and only if there is a good reason to.  Ports
     below 1024 are priviliged ports and can not be used for this
     purpose.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Starting the game,  Next: First login to the game,  Prev: Persistent configurable game options,  Up: Configuring the game

2.4.2 Starting the game
-----------------------

Once done, you start up the system with the following command:

     ./Startmush

It will prompt you to start a new db if it doesn’t find one.

You may also do the commands individually:

     [csh] netrhost -s netrhost.conf >& netrhost.log &
     [sh]  netrhost -s netrhost.conf > netrhost.log 2>&1 &


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: First login to the game,  Prev: Starting the game,  Up: Configuring the game

2.4.3 First login to the game
-----------------------------

Once started, log in the #1 character (Wizard) with it’s appropiate
password (no, not ’potrzebie’, but ’Nyctasia’).  There were private
reasons for the password change.

Once in, do a @shutdown to save the database.  Then you can run Startup
normally.  You may make a backup of your database at anytime on-line by
utilizing the @dump/flat option.  A script comes with this distribution
that allows the ability of auto-archiving your database for a
configurable number of backups.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Important before you actually start building,  Next: Using the prebuilt flatfile,  Up: Creating RHostMUSH with a Provided DB

2.5.1 Important before you actually start building
--------------------------------------------------

The main parts of making your RhostMUSH, easy pleasy:

  1. The stunnel directory contains TLS/SSL connectivity.  This has to
     be linked to another port and will tunnel to the mush port.  The
     README file explains how to set up and configure your TLS/SSL
     connection.

  2. ./patch.sh – This makes sure you have the latest code.  If you got
     this by git clone ‘https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk’ then you can
     ignore patching.  You can use ./patch.sh at any time to update your
     code.  It ignores local.c incase you make your own modules.

  3. make confsource.  Yup, it’s menu driven, nifty eh?

       1. Options you may want to select (other than the defaults):

       2. 5 (%c is selected by default, but choose %x as well for
          MUX/TM3 compat)

       3. 9 (if you want $commands to require the COMMAND flag)

       4. 16 (if you want a wider WHO listing like older versions of
          MUX)

       5. 22 (if you’re converting a TinyMUSH3 or TinyMUX/MUX2 flatfile)

       6. 24 (if you have issues with -lssl not being found)

       7. B3 (for 64 character attribute names)

       8. B6 (select 8K for Penn/MUX2/TM3 default, up to 32K. 64K is
          network intensive)

       9. B5 (will be autoselected if you choose 8K or more.  Pick this
          anyway)

       10. B4 (if you have sqlite libraries and wish to use this)

  4. ’r’ to compile with the settings you selected.

  5. Modify your netrhost.conf file as specified.  Make sure to align
     your port and debug_id as shown in the netrhost.conf file.

  6. If you wish to port in an old flatfile, please refer to the readme
     directory on how to port your flatfile in (README.DBLOADING).


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Using the prebuilt flatfile,  Prev: Important before you actually start building,  Up: Creating RHostMUSH with a Provided DB

2.5.2 Using the prebuilt flatfile
---------------------------------

There are pre-loaded flatfile databases you can use at this point.  The
netrhost.db.flat and corrisponding netrhost.conf file will be located in
the minimal-DBs/minimal_db directory.

You may auto-load the minimal db and corresponding netrhost.conf file
with the command:

     ./minimal.sh

This is ran from within the ’game’ directory.  Once this is ran, you
will need to customize the netrhost.conf file for your purposes.  The
port and debug_id must be changed at the very least.  Keep the debug_id
coordinated to the port as described.

* Menu:

* To load a prebuilt flatfile::


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: To load a prebuilt flatfile,  Up: Using the prebuilt flatfile

2.5.2.1 To load a prebuilt flatfile
...................................

  1. Make a backup of your existing netrhost.conf file:

          cp game/netrhost.conf game/netrhost.conf.backup

  2. Copy the netrhost.conf file into your game directory:

          cp -f ./minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.conf ./game/netrhost.conf

  3. At this point you can modify your netrhost.conf file settings in
     your game directory.  Using an editor modify the ’port’ and
     ’debug_id’ respectively in your netrhost.conf as state.  The ’port’
     will be the port the mush listens on, the debug_id is for the
     debug-stack and is your port with a ’5’ at the end.  So if your
     port is 4444, the debug_id is 44445

     Todo: Clean up the below section

  1. Load in the flatfile into the mush (You could do this in the
     Startmush as well) Manually:

          cd game
          ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new dwF

     Start your mush:

          ./Startmush

     This will load the db that you loaded.

     —————OR——-

     From Startmush when prompted, hit <RETURN> for searching then
     select the number of the netrhost.db.flat that is listed as
     ~/minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat:

2.6.1 Manual configuration of source code
-----------------------------------------

To do manual configuration (skip if the previous step worked for you)
And yes, this is a bit of a pain in the bottom, hopefully you will not
need this.

You need the following definitions defined to make this work:

  1. TINY_U, USE_SIDEEFFECTS, MUX_INCDEC, ATTR_HACK

  2. (u()/u2() switched)

  3. (sideeffects)

  4. (inc()/xinc() switched)

  5. (support for _/~ attribs)

You only need to do this if you received the RhostMUSH src.  If you
received a binary, continue on to the next part.

To compile the code, just type ’make confsource’.  It will prompt you
with settings on what you need to do.  If you just want to quickly hand
edit the Makefile, it is in the directory src (full path src/Makefile).
Then you may just run ’make source’, if you so choose to hand-edit the
Makefile.

After the compile process is done, type:

     make links

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. @dig your master room and in your netrhost.conf file define
     master_room to this dbref (without the #.  So like master_room 2)

  2. Create an immortal holder charater (@pcreate then @set immortal)
     Feel free to set up holder characters for all the bittypes which
     are: GUILDMASTER, ARCHITECT, COUNCILOR, WIZARD, IMMORTAL

  3. @chown/preserve the master room and #0 to the immortal holder
     character.

  4. Log into the immortal character

  5. @pcreate all your guest characters and set them up properly.  My
     suggestion:

          @dolist lnum(1,10)={@pcreate Guest##=guest;@set *Guest##=guest;@desc *Guest##=A guest player.;@adisconnect *Guest##=home;@lock *Guest##=*Guest##}

     Note: @list guest will show your guest characters and if they’re
     set up properly.

  1. Any master room code you load in from your immholder character (or
     @chown/preserve to it) The readme directory has
     softfunctions.minmax that has MUX/Penn compatability functions and
     comsys.  All other softcode (like mail wrappers) can be found on
     ‘https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk’ in Mushcode.

  2. Setup new character, staff, and take tasks that can only be
     accomplished by #1

  3. Set up any other characters you want.  Anyone immortal can issue
     @function, @admin, or anything #1 can do.

4 What RhostMUSH is about and what’s so great about RhostMUSH
*************************************************************

RhostMUSH was founded in 1989, originally by Natasha Davis (Nyctasia)
and as a branch from the original release of TinyMUD code.  It was her
desire to make a game that was flexible, with multiple levels of
progression and highly customizeable.  She lost time and interest and
passed the game to Steve Shivers (Seawolf), Mike McDermott (Thorin), and
Jace Hoppel (Ashen-Shugar)

Through their work, the stability improved, we fixed it to be
multi-platform and as bug free as we could possibly make it.  We
introduced several methods both in game and in source that allowed
consistent memory bounds checking and various alerts for any mischievous
naughtyness in-game or possibilities of any hacks, patches, or
alterations in the code causing leaks or issues.

While not perfect, it has allowed us to have an absolutely outstanding
turn around for any bugs sent our way, which anyone who uses RhostMUSH
will attest to.

Over the years, others have joined the RhostMUSH team, including
Ambrosia (who is the current dev lead), Lensman, Kage (who kindly
provided the UTF8/unicode port), Jeff/Loki, Rook, Noltar, and Odin.

We also have had hundreds of people who have offered (and provided)
help, patches, suggestions, bug fixes, and alternations all on their own
and every single one will have had their name mentioned in the
RHOST.CHANGES file in the readme directory.  It’s far too large to have
in the online help files.

RhostMUSH today provides an amazing tool that allows nearly entire
customization in-game of every single feature available in Rhost without
having the requirement to modify the hardcode.  This includes but is not
limited to:

* Menu:

4.1 Recycle bin
===============

Yup, you guessed it.  RhostMUSH has a windows like recycle bin.  This
means the objects you @nuke and @destroy become ’destroyed’ but not
recycled until they are @purged.  If you use the Myrddin CRON in the
Mushcode directory, it by default sets up a job to purge anything over
30 days old, which should be more than sufficient for any needs.  The
goodness of this?  You can recover nuked things from any period of time,
as long as they were not @purged first.

Commands: @purge, @nuke, @destroy, @recover, @reclist

4.2 @snapshot
=============

Live image snapshots to unload or load to and from disk.  As many
snapshots as you want, as often as you want.  It essentially does a
flatfile dump of a dbref#.  Great for backups or cross-Rhost
portability.

4.3 Wizard and Immortals by default
===================================

   * are spoofable.  Meaning all their @pemits by default will not
     trigger NOSPOOF. If you do not wish this, set the SPOOF flag this
     applies to anyone below their level.

   * override all locks.  There’s two flags to disable this.
     NO_OVERRIDE to stop overriding all locks (including attribs) and
     NO_USELOCK to just stop overriding uselocks.  This applies to
     anything their level and lower.

   * optionally cloak from all non-immortals/God player.  This can be
     highly abused if not careful and there is a @depower to disable
     cloaking and/or dark that will disable this.

   * immortals can optionally supercloak from even wizards.  this can
     not be disabled, and you must consider that immortals should be
     treated as the God player (#1) since they are effectively #1 in
     nearly every way.

4.23.1 Debugging/Tracing
------------------------

   * Debugging in Rhost allows for advanced features like expressing
     where and when to do debugging via a trace() function, with toggled
     labels, and the ability to grep content from trace output.  There
     also exists features to color-match parenthesis, braces, and
     brackets in-game as well as pretty print the output of commands and
     functions.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Zoning,  Next: Reality Levels,  Prev: Debugging/Tracing,  Up: Advanced features of RhostMUSH

4.23.2 Zoning
-------------

   * Zoning in Rhost allows the same functionality of Penn and MUX,
     though the syntax is different.  It also allows the ability to
     belong to multiple zones at the same time and take advantage of
     mulitple zones at once.  This allows for increased levels of
     complexity.

        - help zones

        - help @zone

        - help zonecmd()

        - help lzone()

        - help @Lock type twink

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Reality Levels,  Next: Function and Command Overriding,  Prev: Zoning,  Up: Advanced features of RhostMUSH

4.23.3 Reality Levels
---------------------

   * Reality levels allows for the ability to have a sandboxed
     ’existance’ in each physical location across the entirity of the
     mush.  Each reality is its own sandbox and can either stand alone
     or work dependently with other realities.  A person can belong to
     multiple realities at the same time, and realities is geared to a
     method for send and receive.  Each ’method’ requires to be in the
     given reality to affect it.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Function and Command Overriding,  Next: The Recycle Bin,  Prev: Reality Levels,  Up: Advanced features of RhostMUSH

4.23.4 Function and Command Overriding
--------------------------------------

   * Functions and commands can both be overridden with softcode.  To
     override a hardcoded command you first set the command ignore.
     There are various levels of ignoring so that you could have it
     ignored from mortals but have it executed fine for non-mortals.
     This allows you to use the actual physical command within a
     softcode override.  You may also use @Hook for altering how a
     command works.  Functions are overridden by setting the function in
     question ignored, then writing a softcode alternative that is then
     executed and fetched appropriately.

     Commands:

             - wizhelp @admin

             - wizhelp access

             - wizhelp permissions

             - wizhelp @Hook

             - help @lfunction

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: The Recycle Bin,  Next: Percent Substitution Adding/Overriding,  Prev: Function and Command Overriding,  Up: Advanced features of RhostMUSH

4.23.5 The Recycle Bin
----------------------

   * Rhost has a recycle bin that works a bit like a windows recycle
     bin.  Whenever you destroy something within the mush, it is stacked
     onto the recycle bin and marked unavailable within the mush.  This
     marks the dbref# as garbage in any sense of the word.  However, the
     object is not able to be reused until purged.  Once purged, it is
     put onto a free list that can then be reassigned to a new object.

             - wizhelp @nuke

             - wizhelp @destroy

             - wizhelp @toad

4.23.6 Percent Substitution Adding/Overriding
---------------------------------------------

   * Rhost allows the ability to both override percent substitutions as
     well as creating new ones.  This is done with @Hook and admin
     params and issues softcode overriding.  Due to how it is evaluated
     there is no risk of recursion.

             - wizhelp @hook

             - wizhelp hook_cmd

             - wizhelp sub_include

4.23.7 Hooking
--------------

   * Hooking allows you to have advanced methods to manipulate commands
     including adding customized switches to them via softcode.

             - wizhelp @hook

             - wizhelp hook_cmd

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Command based uselocks,  Next: Differentating between command and listen locks,  Prev: Hooking,  Up: Advanced features of RhostMUSH

4.23.8 Command based uselocks
-----------------------------

   * This allows you to have unique uselocks per $command.  This is done
     through the use of the USELOCK attribute flag, then you set up a
     matching attribute name with a prefix of a ~ to specify how the
     lock is to be evaluated.  This works in the same manner as an
     evaluation lock.  To be able to use the USELOCK attribute flag you
     must be empowered to do so with the ’ATRUSE’ @toggle.  You may also
     use the secure_atruselock config parameter to globally enable this
     and not require the toggle to be set.

4.23.9 Differentating between command and listen locks
------------------------------------------------------

   * We distinguish between commands and listens with uselocks by
     passing an optional argument to all locks that are uselocks.  This
     optional argument is 0 for a default lock, 1 for a command lock and
     2 for a listen lock.

4.23.10 Wizard auto-overiding and how to disable it
---------------------------------------------------

   * By default wizards override all locks, including attribute locks,
     can see all dark exits, and bypass pagelocks.  This can be
     troublesome, and even abusive, so there’s ways to disable this.

        - wizhelp @depower (for those abusing it)

        - wizhelp no_override (disable overiding locks)

        - wizhelp no_uselock (disable just uselock overriding)

4.23.11 Advanced FLAG and TOGGLE control
----------------------------------------

   * Flags and toggles can be controlled to have multiple permissions
     and enable/disable targets of how the flags are allowed to be set.
     This is done through commands in-game or you can use conf file
     options to do so.

-----------------------------

   * We allow advanced site control by not only blocking various sites
     but we can specify how many times a player can be connected at the
     same time as well as how many times sites are able to connect at
     the same time.  This is done through normal site manipulation.

4.23.13 Auto-Registration
-------------------------

   * Autoregistration is the method that a player can auto-register by
     providing their email on the connect screen.  It will email them a
     password and an optional document that the administrator provides.
     This is well described in the wizhelp.

4.23.14 Which bit level is best?
--------------------------------

   * This is something that should be discussed by you and the staff of
     your game.  As a good rule of thumb, only provide the bitlevel that
     is required to do the job.  Too much power is always risky.  In
     essence, each tier of bit can do everything the previous bitlevel
     can do, and then additional stuff on top of it.  The highest
     bitlevel is #1 itself, being bitlevel 7.  Then immortal, which
     should be considered the #1 character in most cases and is bitlevel
     6.  Then the royalty character, which is equal to wizard on penn,
     mux, or other codebases.  For most things, this is the bitlevel you
     want to assign players.  The exception will likely be game owners
     or people who control the master room code.

     There’s a bunch of readme files and online wizhelp that goes into
     detail of the various bitlevels and what each can do.

4.23.15 What are the limits for size/growth for RhostMUSH?
----------------------------------------------------------

While using QDBM, there’s really no set limits for most things.  The
limits that we have are as followed:

   * LBUF - 64K. It is recommended to only use 32K as there is some
     issues with networking with 64K lbufs.

        - Compile time option with the menu configurator

   * SBUF - 64 characters (if configured – it’s suggested you do).

        - Compile time option with the menu configurator

   * MBUF - 200 characters.  Not able to be changed.

   * MAX CONNECTIONS - Limited by the total number of open sockets and
     descriptors on the account and server running on.  There are
     various tools to limit connection DoS attemps and other such
     nastiness.  This is well documented in the netrhost.conf file.

        - wizhelp max_players

        - ~/game/netrhost.conf

   * MEMORY - no limit.  Generally runs between 8-50M depending on the
     size of the mush and the LBUF size specified.

   * CPU - no limit, but has built in cpu abort in code.  The
     netrhost.conf file documents this well for customizing.  the
     default values are usually good enough.

        - wizhelp max_cpu_cycles

        - wizhelp cpuintervalchk

        - wizhelp cputimechk

        - wizhelp cpu_secure_lvl

        - wizhelp heavy_cpu_max

        - ~/game/netrhost.conf

   * DISK - no limit.  Generally will be 75-200M depending on size,
     number of backups and if you leave your compiled object files in.

   * DB Size - (20000 default) There is no limit on the number of
     objects the db can have.  By default it’s soft limited to 20K
     objects, which can be changed by a netrhost.conf file change.  We
     have had this up past 1.5 million objects, and other than a second
     or two of lag for complex searches we had no real problem.

        - wizhelp maximum_size

        - help @quota

        - wizhelp @quota

        - wizhelp @limit

   * Attribute Size - 10K as a hard limit.  750 as a soft limit.  You
     can increase this but it can’t exceed 10000 attributes.  This is to
     avoid DoS style attacks.

4.23.16 Sqlite and MySQL/Maria setup and why use it?
----------------------------------------------------

   * Both of these can be configured separately or conjointly to run in
     parallel.  This can be done through the RhostMUSH configuration
     utility.  You generally want to use SQL for external data storage
     or accessing a central repository of data to share between multiple
     projects.  Like, for example between a wiki, a forum, and the mush.

4.23.17 Executing outside scripts and binaries within RhostMUSH
---------------------------------------------------------------

   * Rhost has execscript() which allows executing outside binaries or
     scripts as a native function.  All effort has been done to avoid
     any type of DoS based issue or hang by doing this, however the
     guidelines presented should be followed before doing so.

4.23.18 Pulling external data into RhostMUSH
--------------------------------------------

   * You are capable of pulling external data in to RhostMUSH using
     several methods.  These are by using:

             - SQL (mysql or sqlite)

             - execscript

             - cron (wizhelp signal)

4.23.19 Integrating a unix cron right into RhostMUSH
----------------------------------------------------

   * The unix cron can be used to integrate with Rhost fairly easilly by
     use of signals.  By using SIGUSR1 you can specify Rhost to execute
     code in-game, which part of that could be to pick up a pre-designed
     list of commands that the unix cron has set up.

4.23.20 Signal handling, how it works, and when and why use it
--------------------------------------------------------------

   * Signals are used to do different things for the mush.  By default,
     the following signals are recognized by the mush and will do the
     following as defaults.

        - SIGUSR1 - will do a reboot of the mush.  This is also
          customizable so that you can have it execute code in-mush if
          you want.

        - SIGUSR2 - will do a clean shutdown of the mush.

        - SIGTERM - will immediately scram the mush as cleanly and fast
          as possible.  It will avoid dumping anything to the database
          to speed up scramming, but write a TERM flat file to be loaded
          in if corruption.

4.23.21 Setting up global parents, global @parents, global attribute formatting, and other global setups
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * Global parents are useful when you want to have a global ’parent’
     without actually having a defined <'@parent>’.  It always will be
     the highest tier in a lookup.  The way lookups will go will be:

          self->@parent(s)->@zone(s)->GlobalParent

     The type of the parent does not have to match the target.

     These global parents can be defined either by using a global
     generic parent or by using the type.  If a type is specified it
     overrides the generic.  The following parameters are used:

             - global_parent_obj - The generic global parent (if
               defined)

             - global_parent_room - The room global parent

             - global_parent_exit - The exit global parent

             - global_parent_thing - The thing global parent

             - global_parent_player - The player global parent

   * Global @parents are different than global parents in that any new
     item of similar type that is created is automatically assigned this
     physical @parent.  It’s obviously more limiting since it sets the
     literal physical parent defined.

     The type of the parent does not have to match the target.

     The following parameters are used:

             - room_parent - The target that new rooms are @parented

             - exit_parent - The target that new exits are @parented

             - thing_parent - The target that new things are @parented

             - player_parent - The target that new players are @parented

   * Global attribute formatting is a method define a wrapper, of sorts,
     where attributes like @desc, @odesc, @succ, and anything similar
     can be processed through this.  All attributes will be either
     &FORMAT<attribute> or &<attribute>FORMAT based on the current
     configuration.  Example: &FORMATDESC or &DESCFORMAT localy, or use
     the following global objects for global formatting.  Local
     formatting has priority.

     The type of the parent does not have to match the target.

             - room_attr_default - Target for room formatting

             - exit_attr_default - Target for exit formatting

             - thing_attr_default - Target for thing formatting

             - player_attr_default - Target for player formatting

4.23.22 RhostMUSH limitations and how to get around them
--------------------------------------------------------

While Rhost is insanely configurable and quite powerful, there are
limitations that exist within it.

   * Function invocations.  Sometimes you will hit a ceiling on
     evaluation.  You may want to tweak values to allow more functions
     or commands to execute.  The following controls that:

        - function_invocation_limit [25000 default] - specifies the
          total functions you can execute per command.

        - function_recursion_limit [50] - specifies the total times a
          function can call itself over and over.  Rarely should this be
          increased and doing so can effect your stack depth.

   * Command queue limits.  Sometimes you want more to be queued up for
     players or wizards.

        - player_queue_limit - Max number of entries a player can queue

        - wizard_queue_limit - Max number of entries a wizard can queue

   * @limit is a wonderful way to lock down limitations per player or
     global.  Lots of power is available here.

        - @limit

        - vattr_limit_checkwiz - Enable @limit checks for wizards

        - wizmax_vattr_limit - Set wizard global VATTR limits

        - wizmax_dest_limit - Set wizard global @destroy limits

        - max_vattr_limit - Set player global VATTR limits

        - max_dest_limit - Set player global @destroy limits

   * Lots of trace output can be cut off.  You can modify this with:

        - trace_output_limit - Set lines of trace output shown

   * To define how many commands a minute a player set SPAMMONITOR can
     use

        - spam_limit – default 120

   * If you examine things and see ’Output cut off’ messages, you may
     want to increase your output limit, funny enough, the name of this
     is similar

             - output_limit - You should set this no less than 4 times
               the current size of your LBUF.

   * Attributes names can not exceed 64 characters.  Sorry, it’s a hard
     limit

   * Sometime you may find a single may not work for an escape.  You can
     in most cases use a % instead or double escape the to make it work.
     Also look at lit() as a solution.

4.23.23 Advanced guest setup
----------------------------

   * After you set up your guests, you can set unique names to each
     guest if you so want after defining the dbref#’s your guests use.
     This is done by defining them in the guest_namelist parameter.  You
     can also increase guests (or decrease them) between 0-31 guests.

4.23.24 Attribute permission masking and the joys of the power behind it
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * Attribute contentlocks can be set up so you can lock the actual
     content that you can set (or even unset!)  into an attribute.  The
     beauty of this is that you can specify case sensitive information,
     lock different ways contents in attributes are set based on who is
     setting it, or even on where it’s being set.  The sky’s the limit.

             - global_attrdefault - Target for defining content locks

4.23.25 The amazing @cluster and what it can do for you
-------------------------------------------------------

   * Clusters is the way to virtually assign multiple objects into a
     single physical object.  It essentially chains together two or more
     objects to share attributes between them, so that any attribute set
     on any object in that cluster can be set or fetched as if it was a
     singular entity.  This allows some amazing ability to distribute
     attribute content or even have a farm of a massive amount of
     attributes without paying a hefty penalty on object bloat.

        - help cluster – Gives a fantastic overview of how clusters
          work.

4.24.1 Note on bits, their levels, and things they do
-----------------------------------------------------

   * IMMORTAL - They can do anything.  Treat this as #1 and only give to
     people you trust.  Period.  You don’t have to use this bit if you
     do not want to and just assume #1.

   * ROYALTY - Unlike PENN/MUX, this is `not' a sub-wizard, this is a
     FULL wizard.  Plus, they can do a bit more.

   * COUNCILOR - Like royalty on PENN/MUX but they can modify.

   * ARCHITECT - Can’t do as much as councilor, but lot more than
     BUILDER.

   * GUILDMASTER - Very limited.  Sees dbrief#’s, can ex things their
     level and lower and @quota players.

4.24.2 You need to @pcreate your guest characters and set them GUEST
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It doesn’t create them on the fly but we considered this better.  You
have 31 total you can have.  It defaults to 10 in the netrhost.conf
file.  You can rename the guests anything you want, but before you do
so, you must add the dbref#’s to the param guest_namelist

4.24.3 @powers are INHERITED
----------------------------

Therefore, you need power_objects enabled (@admin) to make this work
properly for non-plauyers.  A power is taken before a bit level ONLY if
higher than that bit.  Yes, powers are multi-level.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: What are Flags?,  Next: What are Toggles?,  Up: What FLAGS TOGGLES POWERS and DEPOWERS mean in RhostMUSH

5.1 What are Flags?
===================

Flags are pretty much exactly the same as any other mush.  It’s a flag
that you set or unset on a target which then enables/disables or alters
something that target can do.  There’s help on all the flags in help and
wizhelp.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: What are Toggles?,  Next: What is an @power?,  Prev: What are Flags?,  Up: What FLAGS TOGGLES POWERS and DEPOWERS mean in RhostMUSH

5.2 What are Toggles?
=====================

Toggles were designed as a single point flag that immediately enables or
disables a set ability or condition, thus a ’toggle’.  It works exactly
like a flag and was originally designed for two reasons.  To distinguish
from the multi-meaning of a ’flag’, and because frankly we ran out of
flag space :)

5.3 What is an @power?
======================

A power is similar to a power on other mushes, but unlike them, our
powers are multi-tier.  This means that they can be customized to
empower something at a given bitlevel.  You may empower something from
guildmaster up to councilor level.  There are some powers with a power
level of N/A meaning they are a toggle power granting an absolute power
level as specified in the help for that power.  This requires the
INHERIT flag for non-players to inherit powers, however, a specific
object can be granted a power as well.

5.4 What is an @depower?
========================

This is the anti-thesis of @power.  Also, depowers do not require
inheritance.  They also have priority over flags, toggles, and powers.
You can use depower to remove or lower abilities and control from a
target, even a full wizard (royalty) can be depowered.

Please keep in mind each of these bitlevels can be tweeked with the
@admin parameters and with the @powers (accessable by royalty) or
@depowers (only by immortal and higher).

RhostMUSH offers a multi-tier bitlevel system.  They go in order of

========================================

The only thing this bitlevel can not do is directly effect #1, set/unset
some internal flags/attributes, and set/unset the immortal flag.  These
players can do EVERYTHING else.  Treat this bit as you would treat #1.
Only give it to those you know without a doubt you can trust.

6.4 Royalty(W) <Level 5> - FULL wizbit level
============================================

This is your standard wizard.  They can do everything you’re used to on
other mushes that wizards can do.  In addition, they also override all
locks by default (this can be disabled), and they have an enhanced
wizcloaking ability (which also can be disabled).  They can also set all
the lower bitlevels.

   * All things of Level 4 and lower

   * Ability to set more flags: STOP, NOSTOP, FUBAR

   * Ability to @attribute,

6.5 Councilor(a) <Level 4> - High wizbit level
==============================================

This is your almost-but-not-quite wizard.  They have access to about 80%
of the wizard commands.  This includes @nuke, @toad, @newpassword and
the like.  The only things they can’t do that wizards can is cloak,
override locks, and use some of the database manipulation tools in
wizhelp.

   * All things of Level 3 and lower

   * Ability to set more flags: NOCONNECT, WANDERER, FREE

   * Ability to @nuke, @toad, @boot, @chownall, @dbck, @poor,

================================================

This is your sub-wizard.  They still have the ability to control
anything their bitlevel and lower (including @chown, @destroy, etc) but
do not have any control of other players (like @nuke, @toad, etc) but
they can set the slave flag.  Otherwise, all things their level and
lower they can treat as if they owned it.

   * All things of Level 2

   * Ability to fully control and modify anything their level and lower
     (including @cloning, @destroying, etc)

   * Ability to use @tel on anything their level and lower.

   * Ability to bypass jump_ok rooms on anything their level & lower.

   * Ability to set some restricted flags: SLAVE, NO_YELL

   * Has infinite quota and money

   * Able to give negative money (Steal)

   * Able to @toggle the MONITOR

6.7 Guildmaster(g) <Level 2> - Lowest wizbit level
==================================================

This is the lowest wiz bit.  They only have moderate abilities.  They
can examine/decompile anything their level and lower, they can
@guild/@quota people, and they have a few other minor abilities.  They
don’t have free money however.

6.8 Wanderer <bitlevel 0>
=========================

This is a hinderance flag.  This flag is automatically set on new
players that are created (which can be disabled).  This flag stops the
player from creating/destroying any database information.  In effect it
stops them from any type of building type commands.  They still are
allowed to set/unset locks/attributes/etc though without hinderance.

6.9 Guest <bitlevel 0 as well>
==============================

This is a bigger hinderance flag.  By default all guests should be set
this.  This flag stops the player from ANY database manipulation along
with @teleporting, and many other advanced commands.  It’s extreamly
dehibilatating.

7.1 Differences to expect to the end user between PennMUSH, MUX, and RhostMUSH
==============================================================================

The largest end user experience will mostly resolve around some look and
feel.  The general look and feel of how to set attributes, work with
commands and functions, and getting around a grid will be identical
between the mush flavors.  @nuke and @destroy will work somewhat
differently between the three codebases and some effort should be looked
at on how different it behaves.

7.1.1 Differences with PennMUSH
-------------------------------

   - The way the comsystem (hardcode) works with the latest PennMUSH has
     some compatibility now with MUX’s comsystem.

   - The @mail system is different to MUX and Rhost.

   - Debugging code uses DEBUG and has an indented format.

   - The parser for code doesn’t require nested escaping like other
     codebases, but has issues with the pre-parser and nesting.

   - All standard movement, attribute setting, other should be similar

   - Penn allows empty attributes.

   - Penn supports attribute trees.

   - Penn has the standard set of bitlevel flags with on/off @powers

7.1.2 Differences with MUX
--------------------------

   - The comsystem (hardcode) is unique to MUX/TinyMUSH3 and is not
     compatible with Penn.

   - The @mail system is unique to MUX/TinyMUSH3 and is not compatible
     with Penn.

   - Debugging uses TRACE and is the old standard for debugging.

   - The parser requires extra escaping for nested escaping but handles
     pre-parsing and nesting fine.

   - MUX does not allow empty attributes.

   - MUX does not support attribute trees.

   - MUX has the standard set of bitlevel flags with on/off @powers

7.1.3 Differences with RhostMUSH
--------------------------------

   - The comsystem (softcode) is in the Mushcode directory and is
     compatible to both PennMUSH and MUX.

   - The mail system is unique to Rhost but there exists mail wrappers
     that allow MUX and Penn compatibility.

   - Debugging uses TRACE and is the old standard for debugging.  It
     allows advanced features like labeling and grepping for content.

   - The parser requires extra escaping for nested escaping but handles
     pre-parsing and nesting fine.

   - Rhost does not allow empty attributes.

   - Rhost marginally supports attribute trees.

   - Rhost has a multi-level set of bitlevel flags with multi-tier
     @powers, @depowers, and varying other tools for permissions.

7.2 Comparison of features between RhostMUSH, PennMUSH, and MUX2
================================================================

There are differences in the initial set up from Rhost to PennMUSH (and
MUX2).

A lot of people use PennMUSH and if you are one of them, this may help
you.  Some people use MUX2, hopefully this will help you as well.

     Note: If you plan to use sideeffects, you must set the SIDEFX flag
     to allow the target to use it

     Note: Rhost does support UNICODE/UTF8, but it’s currently not part
     of the main branch as of this writing.  Please talk to Kage on the
     dev site for more information on when it’ll be released.

7.3 Organization of help and wizhelp
====================================

First, on PennMUSH, help is separated into ’help’ and ’wizhelp’.  This
can be confusing.  If you want to ’combine’ them, you may use the
following snippit:

     $ahelp*:@pemit %#=[switch([!!words(%0)][match(/search,%0*)],0?,[setq(0,help)][setq(1,0)],11,[setq(0,rest(%0))][setq(1,2)],setq(0,trim(%0)))][setq(a,textfile(help,%q0,%q1))][setq(b,textfile(wizhelp,%q0,%q1))][setq(2,)][ifelse(!strmatch(%qa,No entry*),%qa[setq(2,%r)])][ifelse(!strmatch(%qb,No entry*),%q2%qb[setq(2,%r)])][ifelse(!$r(2),No topics found for '%q0'.)]

This will display help from help and wizhelp for any matching topic.  It
should make life easier for you.  This also honors the /search switch.

7.4 Mail, comsystem, guests, master rooms, etc..
================================================

The comsystem is softcode and included in the readme directory.
(comsys).  Just load it in.  The mail wrappers can be gotten from:

     The Mushcode directory in the Rhost Distribution.

Please see the other readme files on setting other things up like
guests, master rooms, and so forth.

7.14 What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH, TinyMUSH2, TinyMUSH3, or MUX2 to work on Rhost
===============================================================================================================

RhostMUSH, for the most part, will work out of the box with most
softcode gotten from other codebases.  There are, however, exceptions.
Most of these exceptions will be minor code differences between how ANSI
is processed, the variences of arguments or switches to commands or
functions, or required flags.

Most changes will revolve around the ones listed in this document.

7.14.1 Problematic functions between codebases
----------------------------------------------

lsearch()/search(), align()/printf(), *attrval()

7.14.2 Problematic features between codebases
---------------------------------------------

named variables for regexp patterns in $commands are not supported.
@aliases on non-players are not supported.  Frankly I find them
redundant.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Problematic commands,  Next: SIDEFX flag,  Prev: Problematic features between codebases,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.3 Problematic commands
---------------------------

@mapsql, hardcoded required comssytem commands (some are redundant)


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: SIDEFX flag,  Next: Variable exits,  Prev: Problematic commands,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.4 SIDEFX flag
------------------

     Anything that uses sideeffects –DIRECTLY– requires this flag.
     Sideeffects are like set(), pemit(), and so forth.  list(), while a
     side-effect, does not require this flag as it is considered passive
     and safe.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Variable exits,  Next: Zones,  Prev: SIDEFX flag,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.5 Variable exits
---------------------

     Rhost handles them slightly different.  You do not link exits to
     #-4.  That’s an invalid destination.  I always found it, frankly,
     stupid to save any data in the database that was literally invalid.
     So, you link the exit as you normally would, then @toggle the exit
     variable.  At that point you use @exitto like you would any other
     codebase.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Zones,  Next: @powers,  Prev: Variable exits,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.6 Zones
------------

     Zones actually can work near exactly as you would expect them to
     work on TinyMUSH, MUX, or Penn.  Either at once or at different
     times.  We recognize multiple zones, zone masters, zone
     inheritance, zone parenting, zone command processing, and the
     ability to bypass zones entirely.  There’s a ton of flexbility with
     this.  However, the syntax for adding/removing zones is different
     so the commands will have to be ported to Rhost.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: @powers,  Next: Attribute length,  Prev: Zones,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.7 @powers
--------------

     Powers work a bit differently in Rhost and they’re named
     differently, which should not be that big a surprise as they’re
     different between all the codebases anyway.  The big difference is
     our powers are tiered, meaning the can be limited or grown to a
     given bitlevel and are not just toggle powers like the other
     codebases.  We also have @depower that is the anti-thesis of @power


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Attribute length,  Next: Attribute contents,  Prev: @powers,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.8 Attribute length
-----------------------

     While we have 64 character attribute capabilities like most other
     codebases, PennMUSH allows 1024 attribute length attributes.  Why
     you need one that long boggles the mind, but if you do use attribs
     that long you need to make sure they are cut down to the proper
     length.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Attribute contents,  Next: 256 color,  Prev: Attribute length,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.9 Attribute contents
-------------------------

     You’ll be happy to know that Rhost allows upwards to 64,000 bytes
     of data to be assigned an LBUF. We strongly recommand to cap at
     32,000 however as the various TCP socket protocols play nicer with
     that value.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: 256 color,  Next: Unicode/UTF8,  Prev: Attribute contents,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.10 256 color
-----------------

Yup!  We got it.

7.14.11 Unicode/UTF8
--------------------

     Yup!  We got this too.  Not quiet yet in the main branch, but
     download Kage’s branch, you won’t be dissapointed.  We will have
     UTF8 in Rhost 4.0 when released.

7.14.12 Attributes per object
-----------------------------

     This is configurable with the VLIMIT @admin command, however, it is
     absolutely hard-limited at 10000 maximum.  This is to avoid any DoS
     type situation and because frankly there should never be a reason
     to exceed that.  If you need more, use @clusters.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Destroying,  Next: object id's,  Prev: Attributes per object,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.13 Destroying
------------------

     @nuke only works on players.  @destroy works on non-players.  Never
     the two will meet.  We also have a built in recycle bin meaning
     anything destroyed will not be automatically recycled.  If you want
     it recycled, you have to @purge it.  Yes, if you use Myrddin’s
     CRON, it has a built in entry to auto-purge anything older than 30
     days.  This also means you can on-line recover anything destroyed
     before that 30 days.  Groovy, eh?


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: object id's,  Next: lsearch and search,  Prev: Destroying,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.14 object id’s
-------------------

Yup, we got them.  Even in searches, and, well, everything.

7.14.15 lsearch() and search()
------------------------------

     lsearch() in Penn is not syntacically similar to non-Penn search().
     This will have to be altered.  In addition, search() in non-penn
     games have to have special consideration for escaping out the
     evaled args.

7.14.16 @locks can be different
-------------------------------

     We have many more lock capabilities and options so this should be a
     non-issue.

7.14.17 Customer user-locks
---------------------------

     We do not have custom user-locks like Penn.  We do, however, have
     the way to set encapsulated lock data into an attribute to fetch
     and compare against which I find more useful and far more flexible.
     See: lockencode(), lockdecode(), and lockcheck()

7.14.18 Attribute trees
-----------------------

     Unlike Penn, we don’t really have attribute trees.  We do support
     the basic capabilities of it for compatibility if you load in
     softcode that uses it, but it doesn’t have the advanced features of
     attribute trees.  Please see ’help attribute tree’ for more
     information.

7.14.19 Prefix permission locking
---------------------------------

     We do allow prefix permission locking, and some very advanced
     abilities of it.  Please see wizhelp on @aflags for more
     information.  - wizhelp @aflags - wizhelp atrperms_max - wizhelp

7.14.20 align() and printf()
----------------------------

     We do not have align().  Most of the code that uses align() will
     have to be converted to our printf() (which is compatible but has
     different syntax)


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: MySQL,  Next: Mail System,  Prev: align and printf,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

7.14.21 MySQL
-------------

     While we support MySQL, we do not have an async method like MUX2.
     This is just not possible, sorry.

     There are mail wrappers to mimic MUX/TM3 and Penn mail systems.

7.14.24 Various Functions
-------------------------

     There is a ’softcode.minmax’ in the Mushcode directory that loads
     up a slew of @function wrappers that will emulate various functions
     that MUX, Penn, or TM3 has.  We have the functionality for nearly
     all of them, but either our functions have different syntax, or we
     have different named functions that duplicate the functionality.
     It would be far better to recode it to use the native functions,
     but the @function wrappers are there for lazyness :)

7.14.25 Empty Attributes
------------------------

     Penn allows you to have empty attributes.  Non-penn codebases do
     not.  Thus, hasattrval and the like are not needed and should
     likely just point to hasattr instead.

7.14.26 Player Stats
--------------------

     MUX has some built in ways for player stats.  We do as well but
     they’re either done via functions or attribute contents.  Code that
     requires this will have to be recoded.

7.14.27 Percent Substitutions
-----------------------------

     Some percent substitutions may differ between codebases.  Luckily,
     Rhost allows the ability to remap or creaete new ones if this is a
     problem.

7.14.28 Switches
----------------

     Some switches may not exist in Rhost that do in other codebases, in
     such a case, Rhost does allow the ability to @hook a command to
     define your own softcoded switch to a hardcoded command and work
     around the limitation.

     Some flags may be missing.  If it’s a dummy flag, feel free to use
     the marker flags MARKER0 to MARKER9 to set them.  If it’s an

     it or just flag_name it to the other name if you want.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: PennMUSH,  Next: MUX,  Up: Things other mushes can do that Rhost can not and how to emulate it

7.15.1 PennMUSH
---------------

   - Attribute trees.  These are emulated as a base set and can be
     duplicated enough to at least port code.

   - lsearch() will have to be recoded to search()

   - align() will have to be recoded to printf()

   - Penn allows empty attributes.  Rhost does not.  Work will have to
     be done to take this into consideration.

   - All *val() functions in Penn that are used will have to be remapped
     to a non-*val() function.  It should be as simple as function_alias
     to the non-*val.  Example:

          @admin function_alias=hasattrval hasattr

   - Penn’s hardcoded comsystem is emulated with the softcode comsys

   - Penn’s @mail system is workable with mail wrappers

   - Pueblo is not supported.

   - json is not supported.

   - ssl is not natively supported (yet).

   - This uses @shutdown/restart, Rhost uses @reboot


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: MUX,  Prev: PennMUSH,  Up: Things other mushes can do that Rhost can not and how to emulate it

7.15.2 MUX
----------

   - Mux has an async mysql database engine.  This is not possible with
     Rhost.  You’ll have to use the sync method instead.

   - UTF8 is supported but internally passed differently.

   - Mux’s hardcoded comsystem is emulated with the softcode comsys

   - MUX’s @mail system is workable with mail wrappers

   - Pueblo is not supported.

   - This uses @restart, Rhost uses @reboot

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Loading an existing Database,  Next: Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH,  Up: Database

8.1 Loading an existing Database
================================

To load in a previous database, you run the db_load script.

From the game directory you would type:

     ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm yourflatfilehere data/netrhost.db.new

     Note: You may also do: ./Startmush Then you just follow the prompts
     to load in your flatfile there.

If you wish to have #1’s password reset to ’Nyctasia’ please add this to
the bottom of your netrhost.conf file:

     newpass_god 777

The caveat is that you must not have any netrhost.db* or netrhost.gdbm*
files in your data directory prior to loading it in.  It’ll error out if
previous files exist.  So you will need to move all files that start
with netrhost.db* and all files that start with netrhost.gdbm* to
another directory.

Your flatfile tends to be named ’netrhost.db.flat’ which is in your data
directory.  You can, however, name your flatfile anything you want and
have it in any directory you want.

To make a flatfile in game, you just issue @dump/flat.  You can specify
a filename after it, otherwise it assumes the name ’netrhost.db.flat’.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH,  Next: Note about Compiling,  Prev: Loading an existing Database,  Up: Database

8.2 Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH
=======================================================

In the ~/Server/convert directory there is a script called
’doconvert.sh’

This script will convert most flatfiles from existing mush engines to
RhostMUSH. The exception is PennMUSH 1.8.0 and later.  For this there is
a BETA converter penn18x_converter.tgz.  This is proven to work, most of
the time, with codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not been fully
vetted with the latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies.

To convert a non-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you
first need a valid flatfile of the game you’re wanting to convert.
Please refer to the documentatation of the mush engine in question (MUX,
Penn 1.7, TM2/3) on how to do this.  Once you have it type::

     ./doconvert.sh FLATFILETOCONVERT FLATFILEOUTPUT

In this instance, FLATFILETOCONVERT will be the filename (with full
path) to the flatfile you are wishing to convert.

The FLATFILEOUTPUT is anyfilename you wish to name the RhostMUSH
converted flatfile.  I suggest netrhost_converted.db.flat so you know by
the name what it is.

Follow what it asks for and just let it do its thing.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Note about Compiling,  Prev: Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH,  Up: Database

8.3 Note about Compiling
========================

If you are importing a MUX2 flatfile, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that you
select mux passwords as a compatibility option, or you will NOT BE ABLE
to log in to players as the password will not be recognizeable.

Make sure to keep QDBM selected as it’s a much more stable database
engine that does not have attribute limit restrictions like GDBM does.

If you are converting from a Penn, TinyMUSH, or MUX database, make sure
you drill down into the LBUF section and select, at minimum, 8K lbufs.
You likely want that anyway as it gives you far more room for attribute
content storage.

You can go up to 32K safely.  While 64k is safe and does work, there are
issues with networking and older routers that use a 32K TCP buffer size
that can at times cut off the data as overflow resulting in output to
the end-point players not receiving their data.  So it is strongly
recommended not to go above 32K in lbuffer size.

Go ahead and select 64 char attributes.  It allows you to have 64
characters for attribute names.  It’s handy to have.

If you wish at this point to set up mysql and/or sqlite, you may do so.
Yes, you can use them in parallel without any issue.

At this point you should create your master room:

     @dig Master Room

     Note: Reason: You need a master room to contain global $commands

.........................

Load in the Myrddin Mush Cron.  It’s a very handy piece of software and
strongly suggested to do so.  You can find this in the ’Mushcode’
directory off the main Rhost directory.  Filename:

     ~/Rhost/Mushcode/MyrddinCRON

     Note: The globalroom() function returns the dbref# of the master
     room.  Handy!

     @chown/preserve the myrddin mush cron to immholder, then move to maste room.
     @chown/pres Myrddin=*Immholder
     @tel Myrddin=#234 (where #234 is the dbref# of your code closet)

9.1.17.2 AshCom
...............

Load in default softcoded comsystem.  This is PennMUSH and MUX/TM3
compatible.  Filename:

     ~/Rhost/Mushcode/comsys

Chown the Comsystem and everything inside it to immholder:

     @chown/pres ChanSys=*Immholder

Load in mail wrappers if you want MUX/TM3 and/or Penn mail wrapping.
Filename (MUX/TM3):

     ~/Rhost/Mushcode/mailwrappers/muxmail.wrap

Filename (Penn):

     ~/Rhost/Mushcode/mailwrappers/pennmail.wrap

9.1.17.4 Myrddin BBS
....................

Load in Myrddin’s BBS Filename:

     ~/Rhost/Mushcode/MyrddinBBS

Chown to immholder and the contents of it as well:

     @chown/pres Myrddin=*Immholder
     @dolist lcon(myrddin)=@chown/pres ##=*immholder
     @tel myrddin=globalroom()

.......................

There’s other code in the Mushcode directory that you are welcome to
install.  You would follow similar procedures for loading it in,
chowning it, and moving to the master room as you did above.

Likewise, any softcode you find on the internet or on other mushes
should be portable to RhostMUSH with little to no changes depending on
the complexity of the code in question.

The ’retired’ directory has older image files if you’re interested

Please use the netrhost.conf file with the database as they’re linked.

The flatfile must be loaded in as a new db

This is a minimal db with basic ’features’ built in.

Copy the txt files into the Rhost’s txt directory off game:

     cp txt/* ~/Rhost/Server/game/txt

10.1 Version history
====================

     1.0.0

             - Initial database setup.

     1.0.1

             - Small fixes of objid(), isstaff() and bccheck()
               permissions and handling.

             - bittype() access lowered to Architect level

             - NO_CODE flag made visual to Architect

     1.0.2

             - Several convenience changes and fixes: _ Attributes moved
               to @aflags system, allowing Architects to set,
               Guildmasters to see them.

             - @flagdef lowered to Royalty level.  @quota/max,
               @quota/unlock and @convert moved to Architect level.

             - NO_CODE flag made settable/unsettable by Architects.

             - Fixed typo in conf file: ifselse -> ifelse

             - Switched _Attributes to use the @aflags system See:
               Guildmaster Set: Architect

     1.0.3

             - Removed @flagdefs from in-game softcode, converted to
               flag_access_* config options

             - Lowered mailstatus() access to architect.

     1.0.4

             - Changed softcoded objid() to tag(), due to Rhost’s new
               hardcoded objid() which does perform a different
               functionality.

             - Added more staff recommendations to this file.

             - Added Reality TXLevel ’Admin’ to all objects in the db
               except #1

     1.0.5

             - Replaced softcoded tag() system with Rhost’s new
               hardcoded @tag/tag() system.  All previous tags are set
               on the database.  The Tag Object was removed.

             - @function startup on BC-Admin-Royalty fixed - @wait 1
               workaround for Tags in place.

             - Places System @startup integrated into BC-Admin-Royalty’s
               @startup

             - Made @dump and @dump/flat available to Councilors in
               netrhost.conf

     1.0.6

             - A small typo fix in netrhost.conf.  float_preciiosn ->
               precision and functions_max -> function_max.  Thanks to
               <Bobbi@COH>

-------------------------------

   * Limbo, Master Room and Auxiliary room.

   * BC-Admin-<bitlevel> characters set up for each bitlevel to own
     global and data objects, and inherit to.

   * BC-Admin-Mortal is @powered EXAMINE_ALL(Guildmaster),
     NOFORCE(Architect) and LONG_FINGERS.

   * @startup on BC-Admin-Immortal lowers DARK flag access to Councilor
     level, and NO_CODE visual access to Architect level.

   * Global Command objects inheriting from each bitlevel, with a
     separate staff-only object for each level.

   * Global Function objects inheriting from each bitlevel.

   * local Function objects inheriting from each bitlevel.

   * @function and @hook access lowered to Royalty level to remove
     immediate need for Immortals or actual Immortal code.

   * @rxlevel, @txlevel, bittype() access lowered to Architect level to
     remove immediate need for Royalty in many cases.

   * @startup on BC-Admin-Royalty to automatically load @hooks and
     @functions from the Global Function objects, based on attribute
     naming.

   * Misc Data object to hold general data, like Staff lists etc.

   * Reality levels ’Real’ and ’Admin’.

     Note: All created items and players by default are in Recieve-Level
     ’Real’ and Transmit-Levels ’Real’ and ’Admin’.

   * All globals, Master Room, BCs-*, and other staff/code-related
     objects currently have only ’Admin’ as their Transmit-Level.  This
     does not prevent them fromi working properly.  The only exception
     is #1, who has empty reality levels.

   * The supplied netrhost.conf offers a secure setup of options, allows
     Royalty to use @hook and @function, and also sets the
     function_access of several functions to !no_code, which allows
     NO_CODE players to use the comsys properly.

     Note: IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use this .conf as a base for this
     DB. The ’Port’ configuration parameter is XXXX’d out.  Set it first
     before starting your game.

   * All existing objects have been @set SAFE and INDESTRUCTABLE.

   * All existing objects have a paranoid series of @locks set on
     themselves.

   * The +supersafe command is provided on #1 as an example of what was
     used to easily set this on objects.

   * Players are @set NO_CODE and WANDERER by default.  They get 40
     credits on creation, and a 1-credit-per-day paycheck.

   * All *mit sideeffects, as well as set(), create() and list() are
     enabled.  The latter three are necessary for the Comsystem.  The
     rest of sideeffects are disabled completely.

   * Flashing ansi is disabled.

   * _Attributes are settable by Architects, and seeable by
     Guildmasters.  Read: Still invisible and unsettable by mortals.

   * Architects can set up, unlock, and change alternate @quota on
     players.

   * Architects can set/unset the NO_CODE flag.

   * Guildmasters can see _Attributes

   * Architects can set _Attributes

10.3.3 AmbrosiaDB Functions
---------------------------

   * isstaff() - Softcoded function that returns ’1’ if its argument
     matches a #dbref in the ’isstaff’ attribute on the Misc Data
     object.

   * bccheck() - Softcoded function that returns ’1’ if its argument
     matches a #dbref in the ’bcs’ attribute on the Misc Data object.

   * width() - Softcoded function that returns 78 for now.  For
     cross-MU* compatibility.

   * pass() - Softcoded function that takes a number as its parameter,
     and return a random string of that length.  Perfect for setting
     random passwords.

   * cmdmessage() - Softcoded function that takes two strings as its
     parameters.  Returns ’<< STRING1 >> String2’.  The <<>> part is
     highlighted red.  Good for all kinds of messages sent by game
     commands.

   * header() - Highly versatile, and a buffer-saving alternative to
     using printf() for centering with ansi borders.  HIGHLY recommended
     to use instead of printf() for such things.

     header(text,width,filler,fillercolor,outerpadding,paddingcolor,
          leftinnerpadding,leftinnercolor,rightinnerpadding,rightinnercolor)
     text - Text to center
     width - Width of the header, defaults to width()
     filler - Character(s) to draw the line with. Default: =
     fillercolor - ansicode to color the line with
     outerpadding - Characters to frame the outer ends of the line with.
     paddingcolor - ansicode to color the outer characters with
     leftinnerpadding - characters to put at the left side of <text>
     leftinnercolor - ansicode to color the leftside characters with
     rightinnerpadding - characters to put at the right side of <text>
     rightinnercolor - ansicode to color the rightside characters with

     Note: ALL of header()’s parameters are optional.  By default,
     header() simply draws a 78-char wide line of =’s.  Simply leave
     parameters empty if you want to set one of the latter parameters.

The whole DB is highly geared for a low-bitlevel setup.  I am a strong
believer in least-privileges-needed to do the job.  Bittypes and powers

10.4.2 AmbrosiaDB Builder-BCs
-----------------------------

Mortal, with @quota and money for their job.  There should be one shared
BC for each area of the game, like BC-Houston.  Special Rooms, items or
exits that require privilegs to examine or @tel a player should belong
to a BC-Houston-Powered that is @powered EXAMINE_ALL, LONG_FINGERS And
TEL_ANYTHING on Guildmaster level.  If the object actually needs to
modify a player directly, have it use a restricted staff Global, or if
you absolutely must, make a BC-Houston-Admin and @set it Architect.  Do
not give normal builders access to it, only @chown things to it and @set
them inherit after review.

Both the -powered and -admin BCs can have random passwords and be @set
NO_CONNECT.

@set Guildmaster, powered TEL_ANYWHERE, TEL_ANYTHING and optionally
CHOWN_OTHER on Guildmaster level.  Mind that the latter technically
allows them to @chown anything guildmaster- and lower-owned in the

----------------------------

Always trust your head coder.  @set Architect for the everyday bit.
Give access to a maintenance Councilor bit for special code projects.
Finished code along those lines should get @chowned to the
bc-admin-councilor.

If you as the MU* Head(s) don’t know Softcode well, or want to leave
anything Code to your Head Coder, also give them optional access to a
maintenance Royalty bit in order to properly code banning/blacklisting
+commands and other rare code that requires Royalty powers.  Again,
chown finished code to bc-admin-royalty.

-----------------------------

You’re the boss(es).  But please use an Architect bit for your everyday

avoid using either of them except for creating a Royalty bit or doing
intricate DB maintenance.

They already have more powers than any in-game bit can ever have ;)

Depending on actual involvement with your game, their abilities in-game
can range from merely being @powered free_wall for notifying players of
downtimes and/or being @powered shutdown in order to shut down the game
for maintenance, up to being the only person with actual access to #1.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: AmbrosiaDB Globals,  Next: AmbrosiaDB Quota,  Prev: AmbrosiaDB Bitlevels,  Up: Ambrosia's Minimal Rhost DB

10.5 AmbrosiaDB Globals
=======================

Handle necessary functionality for adminning through the admin-only
globals and softcode.

The setup I personally suggest is to have ALL staffers be AT MAX
Architect-level for everyday work and communication, with special coders
that -really- require it having Councilor-characters available to log
into for maintenance or special code setup.  Technically if everything
is done right, the Coder(s) of the game do not require higher privileges
than Architect for the vast majority of things.  Royalty-level code
should be a rare exception, if at all necessary.  The MU* Head(s) or
site-admin should be the only one having access to #1, Immortals or
perhaps even Royalty.  The BC’s, Global Function objects and Function
objects at level Royalty and higher have simply been provided as a
if-necessary convenience.

Current objects are only @chowned to certain bitlevels if it is really
required for them to function.  Whenever possible, they have been
@chowned to the mortal BC-Admin-Mortal.  All custom global functions
listed above are on the semi- -mortal Global Functions object.  The
Master Room and Auxiliary Room have been @chowned to BC-Admin-Architect.

The Comsystem and +bboard are owned by BC-Admin-Architect, which means
that higher bitlevels might not be able to use those systems if they
hide and set themselves DARK. This is intentional.  The Architect
bitlevel is enough to freely set attributes on players, so these systems
did not need anything higher, and it prioritizes Councilor+ as mere
mainenance-duty bitlevels.  Even the MU* Head should log on as an
Architect for everyday things.

The Comsystem and BBOARD have been modified to be configurable by
Architect and higher.  Both systems have a CANUSE attribute with the
according code on them.  Note that if you want both systems to be only
configurable by Councilor+, that instead of @chowning them to a
Councilor after changing those attribute for Councilor or higher, I
suggest to simply @set the bboard and comsystem core objects NO_MODIFY
instead, keeping them at Architect-power but making them unmodifyable by
Architects.

10.6 AmbrosiaDB Quota
=====================

I highly recommend the use of the alternative @quota system.
BC-Admin-Mortal and BC-Admin-Guildmaster both have this @quota system
set up on themselves.  Both of them have a high amount of money for
everyday operations.  You should not give them free quota or money.

10.7 AmbrosiaDB Adding Functions
================================

I also recommend to setup most global functions with /Privileged even if
they are mortal-powered, to make them work even when players are set
NO_CODE and WANDERER by default.

Enjoy!

P.S. the ’bin/asksource.save0’ file has been supplied for loading in the
’make config’ or ’make confsource’ step of Rhost installation.  It

settings, like the ANSI substitution, are used in the DB.

11.1 Considerations to locking down restrictions in RhostMUSH
=============================================================

Sometimes, you want to have things run at various privilage levels and
do not want to have things with too much access.  Weither that is online
objects or players you want to block from connecting to your mush.
Here’s things you can do.

One thing to keep in mind is that RhostMUSH, unlike PennMUSH is not flag
dependant on permission level, it’s ownership based.  While setting a
wizard flag on an object would work, it’s not recommended and it is
instead recommended to chown the object in question to a wizard (like
your wizard holder character) Then the object must be set inherit to
actually inherit the wizard.

     Note: inherit is required to inherit anything from the player.
     Flags, powers, toggles.  The only thing that is inherited
     automatically is depowers.

We have various flag levels.  It is strongly recommanded you check

or can not do prior to giving the ownership to the object.  Things
useful for tweaking control on players and objects.

11.2.6 RhostMUSH Flags and Descriptions
---------------------------------------

     GUEST       - This is your guest flag, it should only be set on guests
     WANDERER    - the WANDERER flag is default on new players.  This flag disables all building abilitites of the player.
     NO_COMMAND  - You can use this to stop a player from being able to connect without worrying about changing their password
     FUBAR       - As the flag states, it f*'s them up beind all recognition.  It essentially stops them from doing absolutely anything in the mush but pose and say.  Yes, it even disables the quit command.
     SLAVE       - Funny enough, slave allows anything but say and pose.  To ruin a troll's life, set both FUBAR and SLAVE and sit back and smile.
     NO_TEL      - The target can't teleport or be teleported
     NO_MOVE     - The target is locked at their location unable to move at all
     NO_WALL     - They do not see any @wall except a wizard @wall/no_prefix.  This has the bonus of snuffing db save messages.
     NO_POSSESS  - Sometimes it's useful to grant a builder character to multiple players.  The NO_POSSESS flag makes it so that player can not be logged in more than 2 times.
     NO_MODIFY   - The target can not be modified (except by immortal/#1)
     NO_EXAMINE  - The target can not be examined/decompiled (except by immortal/#1)
     STOP        - Once a matching $command is found on an object set STOP, it 'stops' trying to find other $command matches.
     NOSTOP      - If a target that is set STOP is also set NOSTOP, it will check the master room for a command and execute that as well if found.
     NO_PESTER   - Stops target from @pemit or whisper.  You may use @icmd as well.
     NO_OVERRIDE - Useful for immortals.  By default they override all locks, including attribute locks.  This makes it so an immortal's passing of locks will behave like a mortals
     NO_USELOCK  - This is like NO_OVERRIDE but only effects uselocks.  You likely want to set this on your immortal and wizard.
     NO_ANSINAME - stops a target from having an ansified name
     NO_CODE     - lock down advanced coding from a target
     SPAMMONITOR - stop a target from issuing more than 60 commands a minute.
     FREE        - Stop costing money for day to day processing of commands/building

11.3 Methods to block anonymous connections and the pros and cons of doing so
=============================================================================

     Now let’s assume you have some troll attempting to use proxies to
     connect.  There’s multiple ways to stop this.

* Menu:

* Blacklisting through external tor_pull.sh script: Blacklisting through external tor_pull sh script.
* Blacklisting through internal @blacklist command::
* Blacklisting through internal @tor command::
* Blacklisting through internal @admin command::


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Blacklisting through external tor_pull sh script,  Next: Blacklisting through internal @blacklist command,  Up: Methods to block anonymous connections and the pros and cons of doing so

11.3.1 Blacklisting through external tor_pull.sh script
-------------------------------------------------------

     In ~/Rhost/Server/game you will see a script called tor_pull.sh
     Execute this by running (from the game directory) ./tor_pull.sh
     This populates the blacklist with registered proxies from various
     sites on the internet.  If you want specified ip’s added, feel free
     to add them at the end of this file.

11.3.2 Blacklisting through internal @blacklist command
-------------------------------------------------------

     On the mush, have as part of your startup @blacklist/load This will
     load in the generated blacklist file for automatic forbid sites
     based on the ip.

11.3.3 Blacklisting through internal @tor command
-------------------------------------------------

     @tor.  Please see ’wizhelp tor’ on how to set this up.  It in
     effect will actively block all known exit nodes for TOR’s
     annonymous proxy service.  It self-updates and will actively block
     TOR connections.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Blacklisting through internal @admin command,  Prev: Blacklisting through internal @tor command,  Up: Methods to block anonymous connections and the pros and cons of doing so

11.3.4 Blacklisting through internal @admin command
---------------------------------------------------

     @admin proxy_checker (please see wizhelp) This little doodad uses
     MTU checking against packet size which will detect most methods of
     proxies.  Sadly, this also has false positives because some
     situations require a differentating MTU value such as briged
     network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or similar
     encapsulated network services.  However, this option has several
     settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies to
     downright forbidding them.  If you’re being actively attacked, it
     may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection.

12 What to Do if your MUSH is Attacked
**************************************

RhostMUSH is an combination of, well, everything.  And because of the
flexibility and customizations, can be daunting, but here we go:

Rhost allows two ways for site restrictions.  ### Site Restrictions:

     @admin PARAM=SITE IP
     @admin PARAM2=WILDCARDHOST

NOTE: Since Rhost 3.2.4p13 Rhost allows CIDR notation (/24 instead of
255.255.255.0)

#### The first method:

     @admin forbid_site=12.12.20.0 255.255.255.0
     @admin forbid_site=12.12.20.0 255.255.255.0 3
     @admin forbid_site=12.12.20.0 /24 3

The first example hardforbids the site from connecting.

The second example forbids the site from connecting after 3 connects
have already been allowed.  This allows connections but stops spamming.

Both options are available for all site parameters.

> Site related config parameters:

     forbid_site -- forbid site from connecting
     register_site -- disallow player creation from site (set to 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 to disable player creation entirely)
     suspect_site -- set site suspect
     noguest_site -- disallow guest from connecting.
     noauth_site -- disallow AUTH IDENT lookups
     noautoreg_site -- disallow site from auto-registration on connect screen
     passproxy_site -- allow IP to bypass auto-proxy blocking
     nodns_site -- don't do DNS/RDNS lookups
     forbidapi_site -- don't allow API connections from site

### Second method we have: (wildcards optional):

     @admin forbid_host=*.buttclown.com *.bob.com !*.foo.com
     @admin forbid_host=*.buttclown.com|3

First example blocks wildcard buttclown.com, bob.com, and removes
foo.com

Second example adds buttclown.com and forbids after 3 connections.

> host related config parameters:

     tor_localhost -- the hosting server that will monitor and block TOR connections
     noautoreg_host -- the hostname for blocking autoregistration
     passproxy_host -- the hostname to bypass proxy blocking
     validate_host -- disallow email from autoregistration
     forbidapi_host -- hostname to forbid api
     mysql_host -- hostname for the MySQL server
     register_host -- hostname to stop player creation
     forbid_host -- hostname to stop connections
     suspect_host -- hostname to set suspect
     noguest_host -- stop guests from connection
     nobroadcast_host -- stop site monitor chatter for site (still logs)

### Special Site Restrictions

> The following specific other options are useful for site restrictions:

     @goodsite -- attribute to set on target player to specify what wildcard IP's -are- allowed to connect from (IP only, no hostname)
     @badsite -- attribute to set on target to specify what wildcard IP's are not allowed to connect from (IP only, no hostname)
     NOCONNECT -- flag to set on player to stop connections

> Examples:

     @goodsite #1=127.0.0.1
     @badsite *twink=12.12.20.*

# Config Parameters

> Example of issuing ingame:

     @admin function_invocation_limit=25000

> Example in netrhost.conf file:

     function_invocation_limit 2500

### Suggested config parameters:

     authenticate -- toggle to specify authentication (AUTH) lookups

     proxy_checker -- set permission restriction level on dynamic proxy detection. Please note, use this sparringly and only if you absolutely have to. The Good news: this will detect most proxies, most of the time. It does this by scanning and comparing the MTUand MSS values and scraping the TCP header for overhead. most proxies require this padding to actually, well, proxy the information out. This means that MSS and MTU values will almost always be a different size for anyone and anything that uses a proxy. Now, the Bad News. Anyone coming out from a business SOCKS server, Firewall, DMZ, or, well, just coming out of a business will likely be identified by a proxy. You use your android device to mush? That's a proxy as well since the android TCP layer is ontop of a java stack. IPhone? Same beast. Pretty much any mobile device will be seen as a proxy, which is accurate, but likely not the type of people you want to block. Sooo, again, use this sparringly. I suggest enabling it to a level to allow monitoring, and only crank it up to deny if you're being directly attacked.

# Commands

### Special commands to monitor/set security:

     @snoop -- Yup, it exists. This is an optional log or real-time monitor of a player
     @newpassword -- change target's password
     @aflags -- list permissions of attributes or set up global prefix restrictions based globally, by target, by enactor, or by sub-group
     @log -- control system logs
     @logrotate -- rotate logs real-time or verify current status of log file
     @api -- control who can set/unset/config/use the restful-like API interface
     @blacklist -- load in the blacklist which is created with the script tor_pull.sh that queries and pulls down the majority of public proxy IP's
     @tor -- control real time TOR proxy protection
     @freeze/@thaw -- real time queue freezing and thawing for sandboxing queues live
     @icmd -- control individual, room, or zone based access control of all commands a player can access
     @nuke/@toad/@turtle -- destroy and/or convert a player to a non-player.
     @recover -- recover a @nuked or @destroyed item from the database. This can be done until the object is @purged. Works like a recycle bin.
     @snapshot -- make a live snapshot image dump of the targetted dbref# for safe keeping
     @boot -- boot the player
     @disable -- disable logins to all but staff
     @flagdef/@toggledef -- in-game alter permissions of flags and toggles
     @site -- remove site permissions set via @admin foo_site (like forbid_site, suspect_site, etc)
     @limit -- assign limits (@destroy, user-attribute, or @lfunction) to target player. This has the effect of enabling, disabling, or overriding the global values for max values. so you can use this, for example, to disable a player's ability to set any user-defined attributes requiring them to only use @va-vz, @desc, and so forth.

# Toggles

### Example:

     @toggle *player=forcehalted

> Suggested Toggle List:

     CPUTIME -- returns extremely useful data on runtime values of a command that executes
     FORCEHALTED -- allows you to @force something even if it's halted
     LOGROOM -- log everything the room sees. This is intended for IC purposes and will notify the player that logging is going into the room
     MAIL_LOCKDOWN -- stop wizards from being able to see other people's mail.
     MONITOR/MONITOR_AREG/MONITOR_SITE/MONITOR_CPU/MONITOR_VLIMIT/MONITOR_etcetc -- drilldown of all the in-game broadcasts for most of the built-in game RhostMUSH monitoring. CPU overloads, attribute caps being reached, success/failed connect attempts, and so forth. Ergo, day to day monitoring needs. The MONITOR foo in Rhost is very beefy, so please refer to the wizhelp on all the MONITOR @toggles for more information.

# Flags:

### Example:

     @set *player=slave

### Suggested Flags:

     WANDERER -- restrictive flag. Set on all new players by default unless configured otherwise. Stops all building/creating and requires removal before building allowed.
     GUILDMASTER -- first tier of staff bit
     ARCHITECT -- second tier of staff bit
     COUNCILOR -- third tier of staff bit
     ROYALTY -- this is your vanilla Wizard on other mushes
     IMMORTAL -- this is essentially #1 and 'all powerful'
     BACKSTAGE/NOBACKSTAGE control flags specifying who can control things set BACKSTAGE
     FUBAR -- stop from doing absolutely everything except ':' and '"'. Nothing else.
     SLAVE -- this also stops ':' and '"'. Used in combination with FUBAR to make a statue.
     INDESTRUCTIBLE -- nothing can destroy the target, not even #1
     NO_CODE -- stops target from doing all but the most basic commands and functions
     NO_CONNECT -- target can not log in
     NO_EXAMINE -- target can not be examined/@decompiled except by wizards
     NO_MODIFY -- target can not be modified except by wizards (or optionally just immortals)
     NO_MOVE -- target can not be moved by any means
     NO_TEL -- target can not be teleported, use teleport, or use home
     NO_PESTER -- target can not use whisper or @pemit
     NO_POSSESS -- target can not log into their player more than twice
     SPAMMONITOR -- target can not issue more than 60 commands a minute

# @depowers

> These are tiered and inheritable from the player.  Meaning permission
levels can be decreased or removed entirely.

### Example:

     @depower/councilor *player=wall

### Suggested Depowers:

     WALL -- disable walling
     STEAL -- disable getting items/gold
     WIZ_WHO -- disable wiz who
     BOOT -- disable boot
     FORCE -- disable @force/@sudo
     MASTER -- disable access to the master room
     NUKE -- disable @nuke/@toad/@turtle
     OVERRIDE -- disable overiding locks (wizards do this by default)
     TEL_ANYTHING -- disable teleporting anything
     POWER -- disable access to @power
     MODIFY -- disable ability to modify things
     CHOWN_OTHER -- disable ability to chown things you don't own

     GIVE -- disable the ability to give... anything...
     NOGOLD -- disable the ability to give or take gold
     PASSWORD -- disable ability to change passwords
     PERSONAL_COMMAND -- disable the ability to use any $commands on anything you own
     LONG_FINGERS -- disable all remote access features
     CREATE -- disable the ability to create anything
     CLOAK -- disable the overpowered wizcloaking ability from wizards
     PAGE -- no page for you!!!
     LOCK -- you can't pass locks. Ever. At all. Sucks to be you.
     COMMAND -- you can't use any $command. Anywhere. Only hardcoded commands for you!
     EXAMINE -- you can't examine/decompile or use any method to list attribs
     FREE -- everything is going to cost you gold
     TEL_ANYWHERE -- you can't teleport anywhere
     PCREATE -- disable wizards ability to create players
     QUOTA -- more more quota control for you
     CHOWN_ME -- you can't chown anything to yourself
     ABUSE -- you can only use $commands on things you own. Nothing else, including master room.
     SEARCH_ANY -- disable all db searching tools
     RECEIVE -- you can't receive anything
     DARK -- you can't go dark, and even if you miraculously were set DARK it'd not work for you.

     Note: Wizards in RhostMUSH by default override all locks and have a
     unique ability called ’wizcloaking’.  If a wizard is set DARK and
     UNFINDABLE then they become cloaked (like a Romulan bird of pray)
     and will be undetectable by any means except by another wizard.
     Immortals have a super-cloak ability that makes them invisible to
     Wizards in addition.  As shown above, there is a @depower to
     disable cloaking if it’s abused.

     Note: ABOUT IMMORTALS: Immortals treat as #1.  Seriously.  They can
     do anything and everything.  They have commands at their fingertips
     to literally hack and edit the database live, and naturally if they
     don’t know what they’re doing, can crash the mush, because of all
     this raw editing capabilities.  Only set Immortal those who
     absolutely need it or you absolutely trust.  Head coders, for
     example, should likely have an Immortal bit.  Also, Immortals by
     default override pretty much every restriction in the game.  A
     player set NO_TEL? Um yea, immortal can still @teleport them.  This
     is intentional, because it’s assumed Immortal’s code should just
     work.  So keep that in mind while coding.  Cheers.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Quickstart for SSL setup with stunnel,  Next: Detailed SSL setup with stunnel,  Up: Setting up an SSL tunnel for secure connection options

13.1 Quickstart for SSL setup with stunnel
==========================================

  1. Modify your netrhost.conf file and add/change the following
     parameters:

       1. sconnect_reip 1

       2. sconnect_cmd SECRET-MAGIC-COOKIE

                 1. SECRET-MAGIC-COOKIE is a case sensitive single word
                    phrase.  Any printable character other than the ’#’
                    character is allowable.  You may use up to 30
                    characters.

                 2. Make sure the secret is a hard to guess phrase.
                    This is used by stunnel to forward on the
                    originating IP address.

       3. sconnect_host localhost 127.0.0.1 othersite.goes.here

                 1. This is optional.

                 2. If you do not specify it it defaults to ’localhost
                    127.0.0.1’.  If your domain has a unique name like
                    ’localhost.localdomain’ like some ubuntu
                    distributions, then you should customize your
                    stunnel_host.

  2. go into the stunnel directory

  3. ./stunnel_setup.sh

       1. Choose the defaults or alter them based on preferences

       2. Make sure to choose the warpbubble conf file

  4. ./stunnel_start.sh

  5. Use ./stunnel_stop.sh to stop the SSL tunnel at any time

You do not need to shutdown the ssl handler if you shutdown the mush.
They are entirely separate processes.

13.2 Detailed SSL setup with stunnel
====================================

To setup SSL connectivity, we use the STUNNEL application to tunnel SSL
to the mush.  This acts a bit like a man in the middle but remains
controlled by the game owner which would have access to the end point
anyway.

     Note: it is assumed you will have already initially set up your
     netrhost.conf.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: stunnel directory,  Next: Modifying netrhost conf,  Up: Detailed SSL setup with stunnel

13.2.1 stunnel directory
------------------------

You would set up the stunnel from the ’stunnel’ directory.  There the
following files are of relevance:

     README                     -- a readme explaining the points of stunnel
     stunnel.conf.example       -- The example stunnel.conf file.  If you wish to create this manually you're welcome to.  Just make sure the end file is stunnel.conf
     stunnel_setup.sh           -- the script to build a stunnel.conf file for you which will be dropped at your specified location.
     stunnel_kill.sh            -- Stop/terminate the stunnel process.
     stunnel_start.sh           -- Start the stunnel process.
     warpbubble.pl              -- the perl script that handles stunnel to mush connectivity.
     stunnel_src                -- If you do not have stunnel, this directory will allow you to download, compile and locally install.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Modifying netrhost conf,  Next: Running the stunnel setup program,  Prev: stunnel directory,  Up: Detailed SSL setup with stunnel

13.2.2 Modifying netrhost.conf
------------------------------

To be able to utilize SSL, you first must set your netrhost.conf file
with the relevant information to enable SSL connectiions.  These three
config options must be set to be able to use SSL, however, sconnect_host
if not set will default to ’localhost 127.0.0.1’.

     sconnect_reip 1         -- This enables the SSL tunnel layer handler within rhost.
     sconnect_cmd XYZZY      -- this will set the secret SSL command handshake command to XYZZY.  This is case sensitive and can be up to 31 characters.  Please make sure to only use printable non-whitespace characters.  Ergo: one word
     sconnect_host wildcards -- This allows wildcarded sites (one or more) to allow to access the sconnect/stunnel handler.  This defaults to 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1' so if you have 'localhost.localdomain' instead then you must set this to whatever is seen as 'localhost' to you.  You can verify this by checking your /etc/hosts file.

     Note: the sconnect_host is optional.  If you do not specify it, it
     will default to two values: ’localhost’ and ’127.0.0.1’.

13.2.3 Running the stunnel setup program
----------------------------------------

At this point you’re ready to run the stunnel setup program.  So at this
point type the following:

     ./stunnel_setup.sh

This will prompt you through settings.  Most you can select the defaults
to.  The SSL port you may need to change based on your administrative
requirements.  It will prompt you with whatever you set for your mush
name.  If you have not selected a mush name at this point, you can
select the defaults.

You will want to use the config file for warpbubble as this hides the
secret.

Be aware that if you have DNS host lookups disabled on your mush, you
MUST have 127.0.0.1 as an entry for your sconnect_host file.

13.2.4 Starting the stunnel proxy
---------------------------------

When you have your stunnel.conf file to the way you want, you then issue
the following command to run your SSL layer:

     ./stunnel_start.sh

--------------------------------------

If ever you need to bring down the SSL layer, you may kill it with the
command:

     ./stunnel_stop.sh


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Configuring firewall on the host,  Prev: Shutting down the stunnel proxy,  Up: Detailed SSL setup with stunnel

13.2.6 Configuring firewall on the host
---------------------------------------

Please be aware that the port that the SSL layer is on must be opened in
any firewall rule you specified to allow the connectivity.  This also
must not be the port the mush is running on and requires a separate
port.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Note about Patching,  Next: Daily Backups for RhostMUSH,  Up: Maintenance

14.1 Note about Patching
========================

There’s two ways you can look to patch the source.  If you plan to run
the RhostMUSH source from a git repository, then please use the git repo
to constantly update your code.  If you knew enough to want to set up a
git repo then we expect knowledge on how to keep source trees updated in
the git repo to be used the same as any other source distribution.

If, however, you have no idea what a git repo even is, or have no
inclination of using git to manage your RhostMUSH source, or just don’t
care one way or another, then you can use the included patch.sh routine
(from under the Server directory) to patch your source at any time.

From the server directory just type:

     ./patch.sh

That will auto-compile your source, auto make all your header files and
essentially keep everything up to date to the latest source.  Once
that’s done, all you do from within the game is two commands:

     @reboot (or @reboot/silent)  -- This will load in the new binary
     @readcache  -- This will read in all the .txt file changes


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Daily Backups for RhostMUSH,  Next: Signals and why you need them for control,  Prev: Note about Patching,  Up: Maintenance

14.2 Daily Backups for RhostMUSH
================================

Make SURE YOU RUN DAILY Backups.  Rhost is very stable, but things
outside the mush can damage the game.  paranoia is fine, especially when
they really are out to get you.  TO make the backups, do the following:

      @dump/flat      -- This makes a flatfile dump of the main database.  You want to run this daily.
      wmail/unload    -- This makes a flatfile dump of the mail database.  You want to run this daily.
      @areg/unload    -- Only worry about this if you are using auto-registration emailing.  Few do.
      newsdb/unload   -- Only worry if you use the hardcoded bbs system.  Most don't use it.


     Backups are already handled and integrated with a script 'backup_flat.sh'.
     If you wish to customize this, feel free.  Again, it is well documented and
     just require changing settings at the top of this script.

     By default, it does 7 contiguous backups.  You may increase or decrease
     this value to any value you want.

     It will, by default, backup all your txt/\*.txt files, your netrhost.conf
     file, your netrhost.db.flat (mush db) file, your RhostMUSH.dump.\*
     (mail db) files, your RhostMUSH.news.\* (internal news/bbs db -- if used),
     your RhostMUSH.areg.\* (the autoregistration db -- if used), and any sqlite
     database you currently may be using which are OPTIONALLY backed up if you
     remove the '#' from before it.

     The backup script also will optionally rcp/scp, ftp, or mail any backups
     you want to a remote destination.  Be forewarned, the backup files can
     potentially get rather large for larger games, even compressed.  The
     average size for these files will be 1-5MB.  It could potentially get
     over 10-20MB in size for excessively large games, so plan accordingly.

     Be aware that the backup system will NOT make successful backups if you
     run out of disk space.  This includes actually running out of disk space
     or running out of disk quota.  There is a mechanism inside the backup
     script to specify an email address that you wish to get alerts from
     in these instances.  I recommend using it.

     If you make changes to your backup_flat.sh script with an already
     active and running mush and wish to just restart the backup procedure
     just issue::

        ./backup_restart.sh

14.3 Signals and why you need them for control
==============================================

Rhost by default allows signals at the shell to handle various processes
in-game.

The following signals are useful.

* Menu:

* TERM (kill -TERM or kill -15): TERM kill -TERM or kill -15.
* USR1 (kill -USR1): USR1 kill -USR1.
* USR2 (kill -USR2): USR2 kill -USR2.
* KILL (kill -KILL or kill -9): KILL kill -KILL or kill -9.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: TERM kill -TERM or kill -15,  Next: USR1 kill -USR1,  Up: Signals and why you need them for control

14.3.1 TERM (kill -TERM or kill -15)
------------------------------------

        - This will immediately terminate the mush, dumping a special
          flatfile called netrhost.db.TERM and scramming the db in
          question by force-closing it without any writes.  A TERM is
          the effort for the mush to shut down the mush as fast as
          possible to avoid any db corruption if possible since a TERM
          signal is common during a server shutdown, so time is
          paramount.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: USR1 kill -USR1,  Next: USR2 kill -USR2,  Prev: TERM kill -TERM or kill -15,  Up: Signals and why you need them for control

14.3.2 USR1 (kill -USR1)
------------------------

        - This by default issues a reboot on the server.  This is a
          special parameter because this can actually be changed in-game
          to do any number of other things.  Please refer to the
          RhostMUSH running in question if this is the default behavior
          or if the method for USR1 is doing something else.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: USR2 kill -USR2,  Next: KILL kill -KILL or kill -9,  Prev: USR1 kill -USR1,  Up: Signals and why you need them for control

14.3.3 USR2 (kill -USR2)
------------------------

        - This will shutdown (cleanly) the mush.  This behaves as if you
          issued a @shutdown from within the game, and follows all
          proper procedure in bringing the game down cleanly and safely.
          This shoudl be used when doing maintenance on the game or if
          you need to bring it down from the shell.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: KILL kill -KILL or kill -9,  Prev: USR2 kill -USR2,  Up: Signals and why you need them for control

14.3.4 KILL (kill -KILL or kill -9)
-----------------------------------

        - This signal can not be caught and will immediately terminate
          the game without any safty to the database at all.  Short of
          something horribly wrong going on, this should never be used
          to bring down your mush.  Doing so will almost certainly
          corrupt your databases (ALL OF THEM) that are open, including
          but not limited to your main database, your mail database,
          your autoregistration database, and so forth.  So if you do
          this, plan to do some database recovery from your flat files.
          Also, when you bring down a mush in this manner, you need to
          issue Startmush -f to bring it back up.

=======================================

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: RhostMUSH has many ways to shutdown the game cleanly,  Next: Autoshutdown script,  Up: Shutting down RhostMUSH gracefully

14.4.1 RhostMUSH has many ways to shutdown the game cleanly
-----------------------------------------------------------

  1. Log into the mush and issue @shutdown

  2. Issue a kill -USR2 to the mush which issues an emergency @shutdown

  3. Issue a kill -TERM to the mush which issues an emergency abort and
     clean shutdown.

  4. Through the Autoshutdown script

     Warning: Never kill -9 RhostMUSH

     Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you kill -9 your mush unless you
     don’t care for the database.  The reason is if the mush happens to
     be saving, in any method, to the database, especially a QDBM
     database, you will likely have just corrupted your database, so
     pull out a flatfile to recover.

     Sadly, this also may occur if the server hosting you takes a
     nose-dive in the middle of a db write.  Rhost can recover
     corruption in-game while up, but if it bombs in the middle of a
     write, all bets are off.  :)


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Autoshutdown script,  Prev: RhostMUSH has many ways to shutdown the game cleanly,  Up: Shutting down RhostMUSH gracefully

14.4.2 Autoshutdown script
--------------------------

The makefile will ’make’ the program that will STOP the mush.  Please
tweek ’autolog.h’ with the proper parameters.

The ’startup.sh’ will START the mush.

Both of these are intended to be used for automations (automated
processes) like your rc.local file and/or startup scripts when you bring
your server up.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Network Port redirector,  Next: Using the built-in cron system for periodically running commands,  Prev: Shutting down RhostMUSH gracefully,  Up: Maintenance

14.5 Network Port redirector
============================

This is a port redirector incase you decide to move your mush to a new
site/port.  To use, first, compile the code.  To do this you would type
the following:

     cc portmsg.c -o portmsg

if ’cc’ is not defined, try the following:

     gcc portmsg.c -o portmsg

Once compiled, you would then modify the file ’file’ to describe the
mush, what was done, where it’s moved to, then specify the IP address
and the PORT where specified.

To launch the application, you would then type:

     ./portmsg file <port>

Where <port> is the port where the mush used to run at.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Syntax for rhost cron,  Up: Using the built-in cron system for periodically running commands

14.6.1 Syntax for rhost.cron
----------------------------

The rhost.cron file will be in the syntax as follows:

     username (or dbref#)
     command1;command2;command3;...;commandN
     command
     command
     command1;command2;command3;...;commandN

You can have commands strung together with a semicolon on the same line.
This counts as a single line of input.  You can have at most 20 lines of
commands after the target you wish to execute the commands as.  The
target may be a player name OR a dbref# of any valid dbref# within the
game.  Invalid targets will abort the cron process.  Non-printable
characters in the cron file will abort the process.  Any aborts or
warnings will be logged in the netrhost.gamelog.

Here is a working example of the code cron file.  This example will
perform dumps of the mush.

14.8.1 Textfile Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------------------

Q: How do I put color in these files?

A1: Look at ansi.h and you need to put the literal ASCII codes.  They
will look like: ^[[0m (for ANSI_NORMAL). That’s <ESC>[

A2: You can enable ansi_txtfiles then use %c (or %x/%m) encoding for
ansi, however you compiled your Rhost.

Q: I want to design my own txt files to read in the mush.

A: Easy.  Design them like help.txt would be set up, mkindx the file,
then you can access it via @dynhelp online.

Q: Do I have to mkindx these files whenever I make changes?

A: Only the ones that have ’& ’ index.  (help.txt, wizhelp.txt,
news.txt, etc)

Q: Do I have to @readcache in the game whenever I make a change?

A: Only when you modify any of the files listed in README.TXTFILES. Not
the ones you use with @dynhelp.

Q: Can’t I just make code in the mush that then is used for these silly
txt files?

A: Absolutely.  Check ’wizhelp file_object’.

15.2 Stack limit and debugging
==============================

Rhost uses a stack limit in the debug monitor.

This stack limit is set to a reasonable amount of 1000.  This is defined
in the debug.h file in the hdrs directory.

This will directly impact the function_recursion_limit from being set
above 100.  If, for whatever reason, you really must have a ridiculously
high recursion limit, then it is a suggestion to manually modify the
stack limit in debug.h to a higher number.

We have reasonably set it to 10000 without too much issue, but keep in
mind, the overhead is higher for every stack you throw on the process
table.  Higher stack means more memory used.

Also be aware that your shell stack limit directly is affected to this
value.

Type:

     ulimit -a

This will show you your shell stack limits.  Do NOT set the STACKMAX
value higher than your shell’s stack value.

The value in ~/Rhost/Server/hdrs/debug.h is currently set as:

     #define STACKMAX 1000

Feel free to change this to a higher value if you wish.

The caveat.  This effects the debug stack daemon.  Meaning, the only way
for this to be updated is through @shutdown and then a fresh
./Startmush.

A @reboot WILL NOT LOAD IN A NEW DEBUG MONITOR!!!!

You can issue @list stack to see the current stack ceiling ingame.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Changes to conf for high-bit CPUs,  Next: Changes to autconf for certain systems,  Up: Troubleshooting difficulties compiling RhostMUSH

15.4.1 Changes to conf for high-bit CPUs
----------------------------------------

RhostMUSH automatically detects 64-bit platforms, and should compile
cleanly on these.

In case you are trying to compile Rhost on some other crazy-wide CPUs
such as the PS2, PS3 or other 128 or 256 bit CPUs, you can easily do so
by changing a few lines of code in conf.c.

change:

     typedef unsigned int    pmath1;
     typedef int             pmath2;
     #define ALLIGN1 4

to:

     typedef unsigned long   pmath1;
     typedef long            pmath2;
     #define ALLIGN1 8

     Note: Replace 8 with the size of your CPU’s long integer.  (4 for
     32-bit, 8 for 64-bit, 16 for 128-bit, etc etc)

RhostMUSH has only been tested to work on the AMD64, but there is no
reason to believe the same will not hold true for IA64.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Changes to autconf for certain systems,  Prev: Changes to conf for high-bit CPUs,  Up: Troubleshooting difficulties compiling RhostMUSH

15.4.2 Changes to autconf for certain systems
---------------------------------------------

You should not have to worry about this, but incase something really
weird occurs, you may need to look into these changes...

The autoconfig.h file needs to have modifications to it by hand.

There are three manual entries:

This one sets how it defines the int to character pointer.  It’s safe to
keep it as ’unsigned int’ for 32 bit platforms.  For non 32-bit, define
it to how an int is defined on that system:

     typedef unsigned int    pmath1;

This one sets how it defines the signed int to character pointer.  Same
restrictions apply as above for unsigned int:

     typedef int     pmath2;

This sets the allignment for the given platform.  4 represents a 32 bit
platform.  8 would represent a 64 bit platform, etc.  Change
accordingly:

     #define ALLIGN1 4

     Warning: Make sure these three entries are defined in your
     autoconf.h file else the mush will not compile.

15.5 Dealing with DB Corruption
===============================

Ok.  Your database won’t come up.

If you are reading this, then likely the scenerio is one of the
following:

  1. The mush says it can’t find your database files.

  2. The mush says it can’t read or load your database files.

  3. The mush seems to load fine but I can’t log in anyone and when I do
     all the names and attributes of things seem to be gone!

  4. Bringing up your mail database

First thing is first.  Don’t have a panic attack.

     netrhost.db.old
     netrhost.db.old.prev

15.5.1.2 Check your netrhost.conf file
......................................

If you never touched the *database or muddb_name params, you should be
good.

Verify your *database params (and muddb_name) are still set to
’netrhost’ as part of the name.  Ergo, the default values and you didn’t
change them.  These should match up with the filenames in your data
directory.

If these names do not match up, it can’t find the database files to
load.  So you shouldn’t have to change these names, ever.  :)

15.5.1.3 Check your mush.config file
....................................

If you never modified this file, you should be good.

The gamename should be ’netrhost’ for this file.  This does NOT control
the name of your game.  This controls the name of all the files as
associated to the mush.  So changing this means the netrhost.conf file,
all your database files, and so forth.  Please don’t change this :)

15.5.2.1 Verify you have enough disk space. (quota)
...................................................

Some account have a limited quota to run in.  If you reached or exceed
your disk quota, you can have a corrupted database.  So always keep your
eye on the size.  quota -s to see a human readable format to see how
much quota you have left.  You want to make sure current in use is below
the ’grace’ and soft/hard limits shown.  If not, you’re out of space.

You will need to remove some files before you repair and bring up your
mush again.  Try to keep your quota at least 200 megs free to allow
plenty of wonderful growth space for the mush.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Verify you have enough disk space system,  Prev: Verify you have enough disk space quota,  Up: If the mush says it can't read or load your database files

15.5.2.2 Verify you have enough disk space. (system)
....................................................

The second way you can run out of disk space is by the filesystem
itself.  do a df -h .  in your ’game’ directory’.  That is df -h
<period>.  This will return how much disk space is being used and how
much remains.  If it shows 100% used, you’re out of disk space and the
db is corrupt.

At this point, you’re pretty screwed.  You can see if anything exists in
your system to free up some space, but if the filesystem itself is
filled, reach out to the owner of the server and let them know.  It’s a
much bigger deal than just your mush if that’s the case.

Until this issue is resolved, you can not repair and bring up your mush.
No disk to run the game.

15.5.3 If the mush seems to load fine but I can’t log in anyone and when I do all the names and attributes of things seem to be gone!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, at this point you likely had your mush up when the physical server
went down hard.  Weither through an emergency shutdown or a physical
power outage, your db likely was brought down hard during a write, so it
left it in a corrupt state.  These things happen.  This is why we always
strongly request you make daily flatfile dumps.

.....................

If you have no flatfile backup or never bothered with backups?  I’m
sorry, at this point you’re SOA. There’s no easy way to recover a

be able to help you to piece meal things out of it, but otherwise it’s a

15.5.3.2 The good news
......................

If you made backups, or if the server had a normal shutdown, you likely
have a flatfile backup.  You will see a netrhost.db.flat in either the
’data’ directory or ’prevflat’ directory.  That is your manual flatfile
backup.

If the server had a normal shutdown, you will see a file called
netrhost.db.TERMFLAT. This is a scram-emergency db flatfile.  It
attempts to write this at the time of server shutdown to hopefully keep
a clean backup in the case of issues since it identifies the server is
coming down hard.  Make sure if you plan to use the TERMFLAT as your
recovery flatfile that the very last line shows something like ** END OF
DUMP **.  That shows you had a successful backup.

15.6 Dealing with a corrupt mail database
=========================================

It says when you try to access mail that mail is disabled and/or off.

Nothing you do can bring it on line.  Well, this is bad, but not
horrible.

The mail db is totally separate from the main game database.  This means
that it in no way damaged or corrupted your main mush database.

The bad news?  Yes.  Your mail database is corrupt.  To bring it back,
is it hopes that you read ahead of time about how to backup your mush,
which would include the mail database.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Backing up your mail database,  Next: Automatically recovering your mail database,  Up: Dealing with a corrupt mail database

15.6.1 Backing up your mail database
------------------------------------

You should be making a flatifile dump of mail db daily by running on the
MUSH:

     wmail/unload

To recover your mail, it assumes you have a mail flatfile in either the
~/Server/game/data directory or the ~/Server/game/prevflat directory.
The latter directory is used in junction to the backup_flat.sh and will
always house the latest flatfile if not one recently dumped in your data
directory.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Automatically recovering your mail database,  Next: Manually recovering your mail database,  Prev: Backing up your mail database,  Up: Dealing with a corrupt mail database

15.6.2 Automatically recovering your mail database
--------------------------------------------------

If you have a flatfile dump of your mail db, run this command on the
MUSH:

     wmail/load

Yup, that’s it.  It’ll take care of everything else.  Isn’t automation
grand?

Doesn’t even require a reboot :)

     Note: You may at this point wish to run the following: wmail/fix –
     this fixes the mail database and sync’s it to the mush db.
     wmail/lfix – this loads in the fixed mail database

If you have a very old mail database, this is likely going to be
required to sync against nuked players and other changes to the game
since the flatfile.

If this is a new db that you have, you can skip the fixing.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Manually recovering your mail database,  Prev: Automatically recovering your mail database,  Up: Dealing with a corrupt mail database

15.6.3 Manually recovering your mail database
---------------------------------------------

To recover your mail manually, you need to delete your mail databases,
reboot, then reload your mail flatfiles.  If you have no mail flatfiles,
well, you’re going to have to start over with the mail database.  Sorry.

First, go into the ’game’ subdirectory.  Inside that directory is a
’data’ directory.

You will be deleting all the files with the following names:

     RhostMUSH.mail.*                (like RhostMUSH.mail.dir/RhostMUSH.mail.pag)
     RhostMUSH.folder.*              (like RhostMUSH.folder.dir/RhostMUSH.folder.pag)

     Warning: DO NOT DELETE OTHER NAMED FILES!!!

Once these files are deleted, you may issue a @reboot to restart the
mush.  This will unlock the mail system and load in a fresh db.

Now, if you have flatfiles of the old mail database, you will see in
either the ’data’ directory or the ’prevflat’ directory files that are
called:

     RhostMUSH.dump.folder
     RhostMUSH.dump.mail

Make sure these two files are in the ’data’ subdirectory.  Copy them in
if they exist in your ’prevflat’ directory.

Once they are in the ’data’ directory, within the mush type: wmail/load

This loads in the flatfile and recover the mail database.

Now, at this point the mail db may not be 100% in-sync with the game db.

So let’s fix it.

wmail/fix – this will run a fix on the mail db and repair any issues.

wmail/lfix – this will load the fixed flatfile back into the mush.

At this point you should be good to go.

-----------------------------------------

This requires hooking your changes into local.c, then modifying the

16.1.2 Adding an @startup to make use of modules
------------------------------------------------

This means that if your code is depending on @startups, you need to put
a delay in the @startup so that your local code can be loaded in as
modules prior to the @startup execution.

Something that will not work:

     @startup me=@superhappyfuncommand loadmeup=now

A small alteration that will likely make this work fine:

     @startup me=@wait 1=@superhappyfuncommand loadmeup=now

That 1 second delay for the queue will give the game engine time to load
in your module code.

result is not 0, then X sees Y. If the result is 0, as far as X is
concerned, Y doesn’t exist.  This affects contents lists, exit lists,
look, say, pose, @emit, @verb, connect/disconnect, has arrived/has left
messages, exit and object matching.  ’here’ and ’me’ match always.

It doesn’t affect @remit, @pemit, page, WHO or channels.  By default,
all new objects are created with an RxLevel of 1 and TxLevel of 1.
Rooms are an exception, created with an RxLevel of 1 and a TxLevel of
0xFFFFFFFF. Those default levels can be changed with configuration
parameters.

An object is always visible to itself, even if its Rx and Tx levels
don’t match.  (See examples below)

16.2.2 Reality Levels Descriptions
----------------------------------

For every reality level defined, you can define an attribute that serves
as description.  If you look at something and match more than one of its
TxLevels, you’ll see all the corresponding descriptions on the target
object.  If the object doesn’t have any descriptions for the matching
levels, you’ll see the regular @desc.

The @adesc attribute on the target is only triggered if the target can
see the looker in turn.  It’s only triggered once, no matter how many
descs the looker sees.  The @odesc is shown only to those people that
see /both/ the looker and the target.

Through extension, @afail/@ofail and similar pairs (@adrop/@odrop,
@asucc/@osucc etc) work in the same way.  @verb commands are similary
affected.

Softcoded commands are only matched on the objects that can see the
player.  The player doesn’t have to see the object.  This includes
commands in the Master Room.

Exits are treated specially.  In order to be able to use an exit name
(or to use the ’move <exit>’ command) the exit must be visible to the
enactor.  In order to pass through the exit, the exit must see the
enactor in turn.  There are reasons for this, which will become evident
in the examples below.

16.2.3 Reality Levels Configuration parameters
----------------------------------------------

A few configuration parameters have been introduced to deal with the
reality levels:

     reality_level <name> <value> [<desc attribute name>]

This directive can only be used in the config file (not with the @admin
command) and should be repeated for each reality level you want to
define.  It defines a new level named <name> with a bitvalue of <value>
and an optional desc attribute.  There is a limit of 8 characters on
<name>, a 32-bit value on <value> (basically an unsigned long) and 32
characters on the attribute name.  A maximum of 32 reality levels can be
defined:

     def_exit_tx <value>
     def_exit_rx <value>
     def_room_tx <value>
     def_room_rx <value>
     def_player_rx <value>
     def_player_tx <value>
     def_thing_rx <value>
     def_thing_tx <value>

These 8 directives define the default reality levels of newly created
objects.  They can be set in the config file or with the @admin command.
Like above, <value> must be a decimal number:

     wiz_always_real <0|1>

If this parameter is set to 1 then wizards (and immortals on Rhost) will
see everything and will be visible to everyone.  Their effective Rx and
Tx levels will always be 0xFFFFFFFF. Also settable in the config file
and with the @admin command.

Compile with -DREALITY_LEVELS compile time option to enable ’Real’ needs
to be ’1’ This is an example file only to be added to the mush.conf file
Format:

     reality_level <8 char name> <hex-byte-mask> <optional-desc: DESC default>

16.2.5 Reality Levels Commands
------------------------------

Two wiz-only commands are used to set the reality levels of an object:

     @rxlevel <object>=<list>
     @txlevel <object>=<list>

<list> is a space-separated list of level names that have to be set on
the object.  If a level name is prefixed with an exclamation mark (!)
that level will be cleared from the object.

     Warning: Changing the Tx levels of an object might make it
     invisible to you.  In this case, you can still manipulate it by
     using his #dbref (or *player for players).


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Functions,  Next: Example 1 A simplified Witchcraft setup,  Prev: Reality Levels Commands,  Up: Reality Levels Setup

16.2.6 Functions
----------------

There are five functions that deal with reality levels:

     hasrxlevel(<object>,<level>)
     hastxlevel(<object>,<level>)

These two functions check if an object has the specified Rx or Tx level.
You must control <object>.  They return 0 or 1 and #-1 in case the
object does not exist or you don’t have permissions:

     rxlevel(<object>)
     txlevel(<object>)

These two functions return a space-separated list of the object’s Rx or
Tx levels.  Again, you must control the object:

     cansee(<obj1>,<obj2>)

A wiz-only function, returns 1 of <obj1> can see <obj2> from a reality
levels point of view.  It doesn’t check if the objects are in the same
location, the DARK/CLOAKED flags and so on.  Just <obj1>’s Rx level
against <obj2>’s Tx level.

     Warning: If you are using it on MUX2.0 with /both/ reality levels
     and Wod Realms enabled, the function will perform both checks and
     the Wod Realms version checks against the DARK flag.

16.2.7 Example 1: A simplified Witchcraft setup
-----------------------------------------------

In Witchcraft, besides the various Gifted classes, characters can be
spirits There are spirit realms to which the mundane can not travel.
Therefore we will use 2 reality levels: Real and Ghost.  Since some
spirits can become solid for a limited period of time, we will also use
an additional desc for the Ghost level, called GHOSTDESC. Therefore in
the config file we will have:

     reality_level Real 1
     reality_level Ghost 2 GHOSTDESC

Ghosts can pass through most mundane locks, so the exists should allows
the ghosts to pass:

     def_exit_rx 3

Note that def_exit_tx isn’t set.  Why?  Because ghosts see the mundane
world anyway, so a spirit character will have:

     @txlevel <player>=!Real Ghost
     @rxlevel <player>=Real Ghost

Let’s assume 3 players:

     John is a Mundane. He won't see spirits.
     John's Rx: Real
     John's Tx: Real
     John's @desc: This is John.
     John's &GHOSTDESC: (Not important, since it's never visible)
     Johh's @adesc: %N has looked at you.
     John's @odesc: has looked at John.

Jack is a Gifted.  He will sense spirits, but is still made from flesh
and blood so visible to mundanes:

     Jack's Rx: Real Ghost
     Jack's Tx: Real
     Jack's @desc: This is Jack.
     Jack's &GHOSTDESC: (Not important, since it's never visible)
     Jack's @adesc: %N has looked at you.
     Jack's @odesc: has looked at Jack.

Frank is a ghost.  He will see other spirits as well as mundanes, but
won’t be visible to mundanes.  He can also become visible to everybody:

     Frank's Rx: Real Ghost
      Frank's Tx: Ghost
      Frank's @desc: This is Frank, looking human.
      Frank's &GHOSTDESC: This is Frank's ghostly shape.
      Frank's @adesc: %N has looked at you.
      Frank's @odesc: has looked at Frank.

Following are commands that each of the players enter and what they see.
I’ll assume the +materialize command is defined like:

     &CMD_MATERIALIZE <cmdobject>=$+materialize:@txlevel %#=Real; @pemit %#=You are now material.

16.2.8 Example 2: A WoD setup
-----------------------------

The reality levels will be defined like this:

     reality_level         Real 1
     reality_level         Obf1 2
     reality_level         Obf2 4
     reality_level         Obf3 8 OBFDESC
     reality_level         Obf4 16 OBFDESC
     reality_level         Obf5 32 OBFDESC
     reality_level         Umbra 64 UMBRADESC
     reality_level         Fae 128 FAEDESC
     reality_level         Shadow 256 SHADOWDESC
     reality_level         All 511

5 levels of Obfuscation, Umbra, Dreaming, Wraiths.  ’All’ is a handy
replacement for all levels, useful for wizards and wizobjects that
should be visible on all levels.  Also useful when you want to set an
object’s levels to something without knowing what he had before:

     @rxlevel #276=!All Real

!All will clear all levels, then the object will gain the Real level.
There is more than one Obfuscation level because of the relation between
Auspex and Obfuscation.

A vampire with Obfuscate 2, should not be visible by one with Auspex 1.
However one with Auspex 3 should see another vampire with Obfuscate 1, 2
/or/ 3.

Obfuscated players can move if they have Obf > 1.  Umbral and Shadow
players should also be able to see most of the exits.  So the exits at
creation should have default levels of Real + Obf2 + Obf3 + Obf4 + Obf5
+ Umbra + Shadow = 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 256 = 381:

     def_exit_rx 381
     def_exit_tx 381

Obf1 is not included since an Obfuscated vampire should not be able to
move if it only has Obf1.  Therefore they won’t see the exits.  If you
want them to be able to see the exits, but not to use them, change the
default Tx of the exits:

     def_exit_rx 381
     def_exit_tx 383

Joe the Mortal will have an RxLevel: Real and a TxLevel: Real Jack the
Malk, who likes to walk around Obfuscated and has Obfuscate 2 will have
an RxLevel: Real (he sees what the mortals see) but a TxLevel: Obf2
Jimmy the Nossie, who is using the Mask and has Obfuscate 4, but doesn’t
try to make himself invisible will have an RxLevel: Real (as Jack) and a
TxLevel: Real Obf4.  He will also set his @desc to what the mortals see
and &OBFDESC to his real slimy desc.  Simply put, he will be visible to
mortals, but not with his real desc.

Aldrin the Gangrel, has Auspex 4 and activates it.  Therefore, his
TxLevel will still be Real, but RxLevel: Real Obf1 Obf2 Obf3 Obf4 (all
of them).  So he can see Joe, Jack and Jimmy’s both descs.  Joe, on the
other hand, won’t see Jack at all.  He will still see Jimmy, but only
Jimmy’s @desc, not the OBFDESC

Frida the Fae...  will have RxLevel: Real Fae and TxLevel: Real Fae.
@desc set to the mundane desc, &FAEDESC set to the Chimerical desc.
Emily the Enchanted will have an RxLevel: Real Fae, but the TxLevel:
Real.  No &FAEDESC on her, although she’ll be able to see it the one on
Frida.  Gil the Garou, while travelling through the Umbra, will have
RxLevel: Umbra and TxLevel: Umbra.  &UMBRADESC is his friend.  He won’t
see mortals or other characters who are not in the Umbra.

Barbie the Bastet, who’s only peeking in the Umbra, without going there,
will have RxLevel: Umbra, TxLevel: Real.  Dangerous position since she
can’t see the things that see her.

Deanna the Drake, who activates her spirit vision, will have RxLevel:
Real Umbra and TxLevel: Real.  She will see characters in Umbra and real
world at the same time and perceive the desc appropiate to the realm the
ohter character is in.

Wanda the Wraith: RxLevel: Real Shadow, TxLevel: Shadow.  Her @desc
would be empty, but the &SHADOWDESC should be set.  Marie the Mortal+
Medium: RxLevel: Real Shadow, TxLevel: Real

Global code objects that all characters should be able to use:

     RxLevel: All, TxLevel: All

16.3.4 Exescript Notes and warnings
-----------------------------------

While MUSHL_VARS are sanitized on what is allowable as a mush variable,
this is not necessarilly sanitized on what the calling script can fetch
as a valid variable.  Of note, you can not set environment variables
that contain an equals sign.  Be aware of this limitation.

Remember, MUSHL_VARS is the environment variable seen by the script.
This is EXECSCRIPT_VARS on the mush itself, that is the attribute set on
the target that contains the execscript() that is being executed.

16.4 Using printf() for advanced text output
============================================

The function printf() in Rhost can be used to greatly reduce coding in
efforts for outputs, screens and data display.  It can automatically
center, justify and wrap the text parameters given to it.

ZONES: Zones are special.  If there are no zones, the value will be
’-1’.

So entering zones if there are no zones:

     -1

Entering zones if it has three zones (#123, #456, and #789):

     123
     456
     789
     -1

As you see, the last value of the zone `MUST' be -1.  This tells it that
there are no more zones to add.

=============================================

Ok, if you plan to recompile your game that is using GDBM to QDBM, or
visa versa some bad news.

The databases are NOT COMPATIBLE to each other, at least in the binary
form.

19.1.1 Downgrading QDBM to GDBM
-------------------------------

     Warning: I would NEVER change from QDBM back to GDBM, but if you’re
     set on it these steps:

     You would use the same steps if you plan to move QDBM to GDBM. I
     however would not do this.  Moving from QDBM to GDBM is a huge step
     backwards.  Seriously, don’t do it unless you have absolutely no
     other recourse.

     IF you plan (for whatever reason) to move from QDBM to GDBM, you
     should verify the following

  1. You have on a 64 bit system, no object that has more than 400
     attributes on it.

  2. You have on a 32 bit system, no object that has more than 750
     attributes on it.

  3. Any CONTENT of any attribute must be below 4000 characters in
     length.

  4. Once you have that done, you may follow the procedures below on
     converting (upgrade) from GDBM to QDBM. This works the same as
     converting (downgrading) QDBM back down to GDBM

Now, if you’ve kept reading and plan to convert your GDBM database to
QDBM great news!  It’s more stable, it’s faster, and lets you have far
more flexibility.

19.2 Updating RhostMUSH prior to 3.9.5p2
========================================

Ok.

So you’re running an old RhostMUSH.

One prior to 3.9.5p2 and want to take advantage of the new format of the
Makefile and the automated mysql stuff and all the other goodies that
isn’t really (easilly) done with just patch.sh.

Well, you’re in luck.  It is actually fairly easy to do.

This is what you have to do.

First thing’s first.

  1. Log into your existing mush.  Let’s make current backups of all
     your flatfiles.  Issue:

          @dump/flat
          wmail/unload
          @areg/unload
          newsdb/unload

  2. Shutdown your game:

          @shutdown

  3. Make an image of all your current backed up files.  From The
     Server/game directory you would type:

          ./backup_flat.sh -s

     Note: Please remember the ’-s’ to the ./backup_flat.sh.

  1. Make note of the most recently created file in the directory
     Server/game/oldflat.  It’s usually named something like:

          RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz

     Note: You will need this file later.

  1. Rename your ’Rhost’ directory to something else.  This is the
     directory that you have containing the ’Server’ directory.  Name it
     anything you want other than ’Rhost’.  For those not used to unix
     you would type:

          mv Rhost Rhost_old

  2. Pull in the latest Rhost.  You would type:

          git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost

     Note: You would type this in the same directory you have renamed
     your old ’Rhost’ directory

  1. go into the Rhost/Server directory.  Type:

          make confsource

     Note: Select what options you want (including the mysql and other
     goodies) then compile it (also within the menu, it’s the ’r’
     option).

  1. Once your game is compiled and ready to go you need to copy in the
     data from your old game.  Copy the RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz we
     mentioned in step #4 to the Server/game directory of your NEW GAME
     DIRECTORY. From within the ’game’ directory of your current game
     you should be able to issue (if you named the old one Rhost_old).
     Again this needs to be done FROM YOUR Server/game directory!!!

       1. cp netrhost.conf netrhost.conf.orig

       2. cp ../../Rhost_old/Server/game/RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz .

       3. tar -zxvf RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz

       4. Compare your current netrhost.conf to the default one that
          came with the source (that you renamed to netrhost.conf.orig).
          Likely the only sections you have to add to your current
          netrhost.conf (that came with your RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz
          archive), will be toward the end, with the include
          rhost_ingame.conf and rhost_mysql.conf.  Depending on how old
          your game is coming from you may need to add more options.
          Any config option that is the same between the netrhost.conf
          files do not have to be copied over, and you want to keep your
          custom settings (like don’t port or other stuff you have
          already customized).

       5. Load in your flatfile information:

               ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm data/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new

       6. Your ./Startmush should re-index all your txt files you
          originally made:

               ./Startmush

       7. In your game type the following as an immortal or as #1.

            1. Load in your mail flatfile:

                    wmail/load

            2. Load in your autoregistration flatfile (if available):

                    @areg/load

            3. Load in your hardcoded bbs flatfile (if available):

                    newsdb/load

  1. You should be good to go on a current directory structure for
     Rhost.  Enjoy!

19.3 Adding MySQL to RhostMUSH older than 3.9.5p2
=================================================

MySQL is now native in RhostMUSH as of 3.9.5p2.

     Warning: To autodetect it, YOU MUST HAVE mysql_config installed and
     running on your server.  Without this, even if you have mysql db
     installed it won’t be able to recognize the parameters you will
     need for it and will thus fail.  Please check your linux
     distribution to see what packages are needed to install
     mysql_config.

Download the git repository to a seperate directory so that you can copy
over the files that it requires you to.

Suggestion:

     git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk ~/tmprho

If you are patching UP from an older version, you need to update the
following files:

  1. update your src/Makefile to the one in the 3.9.5p2+ repo ( cp
     ~/tmprho/Server/src/Makefile ~/Rhost/Server/src/Makefile )

  2. update your bin/asksource.* files to the one in the 3.9.5p2+ repo (
     cp ~/tmprho/Server/bin/asksource.* ~/Rhost/Server/bin/ )

  3. append ’include rhost_mysql.conf’ BEFORE the rhost_ingame.conf file
     and before the section that says ’define local aliases’ toward the
     end of your netrhost.conf file.  ( edit your
     ~/Rhost/Server/game/netrhost.conf file )

  4. copy the game/rhost_mysql.conf file from the 3.9.5p2+ repo ( cp
     ~/tmprho/Server/game/rhost_mysql.conf ~/Rhost/Server/game/ )

  5. The following lines have to be REPLACED/CHANGED in local.c ( toward
     the top ): ( you may edit this or copy the one from the other
     distro ) ( do either: edit ~/Rhost/Server/src/local.c ) ( or: cp
     ~/tmprho/Server/src/local.c ~/Rhost/Server/src/local.c )

     Note: IF REPLACING/CHANGING local.c COPY BELOW

     /* Called when the mush starts up, immediatly prior to the main game
     * loop being entered. By this point all databases are loaded and
     * all variables configured.
     */
     #ifdef MYSQL_VERSION
      extern void local_mysql_init(void);
      extern int sql_shutdown(dbref player);
     #endif

     #ifdef SQLITE
      extern void local_sqlite_init(void);
     #endif /* SQLITE */

     void local_startup(void) {
     #ifdef SQLITE
      local_sqlite_init();
     #endif /* SQLITE */
     #ifdef MYSQL_VERSION
      local_mysql_init();
     #endif
      load_regexp_functions();
     }

     /* Called immediatly after the main game loop exits. At this point
     * all databases and variables are still configured
     */
     void local_shutdown(void) {
     #ifdef MYSQL_VERSION
      sql_shutdown(-1);
     #endif
     }

  1. Issue ’make clean’ then make confsource to rebuild using the latest
     builder script to build in the mysql changes.

22 Historical Non-Disclosure Agreement
**************************************

The following NDA comes from the time when RhostMUSH was not publially
available.  It is preserved here for historical reasons.  We are suckers
for looking back at things.  :)

          –Ambrosia

       1. I agree, to not give out the code, in part or in full, in any
          form of medium, to anyone or anything not previously allowed
          by the developers.

       2. I agree, to not let others look at the code, in part or in
          full, in any form of medium, to anyone or anything not
          previously allowed by the developers.

       3. I am aware that any modifications I make to the code is
          _FULLY_ permitted, and that I do _NOT_ have to return said
          patches to the developers.

     Note: The Rhost developers would like to see what was added, and
     possibly look at adding them to the main distro if we see others
     would like it (with full credits to you), but we belive once you
     have the code, you should be allowed to play with it fully as long
     as the first two rules are kept.
