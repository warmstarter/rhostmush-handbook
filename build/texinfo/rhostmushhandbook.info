The RhostMUSH source tree offers many abilities and options not normally
found in any other flavor of mush.  This doesn’t make it better than
other servers (though we think so `j/k') but it does give you a wider
selection of configurability, which, as you know, is the best part of
setting up a mush.  (yea, right)

1.1 What RhostMUSH is about and what’s so great about RhostMUSH
===============================================================

RhostMUSH was founded in 1989, originally by Natasha Davis (Nyctasia)
and as a branch from the original release of TinyMUD code.  It was her
desire to make a game that was flexible, with multiple levels of
progression and highly customizeable.  She lost time and interest and
passed the game to Steve Shivers (Seawolf), Mike McDermott (Thorin), and
Jace Hoppel (Ashen-Shugar)

Through their work, the stability improved, we fixed it to be
multi-platform and as bug free as we could possibly make it.  We
introduced several methods both in game and in source that allowed
consistent memory bounds checking and various alerts for any mischievous
naughtyness in-game or possibilities of any hacks, patches, or
alterations in the code causing leaks or issues.

While not perfect, it has allowed us to have an absolutely outstanding
turn around for any bugs sent our way, which anyone who uses RhostMUSH
will attest to.

Over the years, others have joined the RhostMUSH team, including
Ambrosia (who is the current dev lead), Lensman, Kage (who kindly
provided the UTF8/unicode port), Jeff/Loki, Rook, Noltar, and Odin.

We also have had hundreds of people who have offered (and provided)
help, patches, suggestions, bug fixes, and alternations all on their own
and every single one will have had their name mentioned in the
RHOST.CHANGES file in the readme directory.  It’s far too large to have
in the online help files.

RhostMUSH today provides an amazing tool that allows nearly entire
customization in-game of every single feature available in Rhost without
having the requirement to modify the hardcode.  This includes but is not
limited to:

* Menu:

* Recycle bin::
* @snapshot::
* Wizard and Immortals by default::
* Titles and Captions to a player’s name::
* Have an alternate name with locks for NPC obfuscation::
* Have multiple player aliases::
* Actively control how dark works both game-wide and individually::
* Make config file changes in-game without having to reboot or have shell access::
* Execute any binary or script as a localized function::
* Customized percent substitutions (like %n, %#, etc): Customized percent substitutions like %n %# etc.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Recycle bin,  Next: @snapshot,  Up: What RhostMUSH is about and what’s so great about RhostMUSH

1.1.1 Recycle bin
-----------------

     Yup, you guessed it.  RhostMUSH has a windows like recycle bin.
     This means the objects you @nuke and @destroy become ‘destroyed’
     but not recycled until they are @purged.  If you use the Myrddin
     CRON in the Mushcode directory, it by default sets up a job to
     purge anything over 30 days old, which should be more than
     sufficient for any needs.  The goodness of this?  You can recover
     nuked things from any period of time, as long as they were not
     @purged first.  Commands: @purge, @nuke, @destroy, @recover,
     @reclist


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: @snapshot,  Next: Wizard and Immortals by default,  Prev: Recycle bin,  Up: What RhostMUSH is about and what’s so great about RhostMUSH

1.1.2 @snapshot
---------------

     Live image snapshots to unload or load to and from disk.  As many
     snapshots as you want, as often as you want.  It essentially does a
     flatfile dump of a dbref#.  Great for backups or cross-Rhost
     portability.  Command: @snapshot


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Wizard and Immortals by default,  Next: Titles and Captions to a player’s name,  Prev: @snapshot,  Up: What RhostMUSH is about and what’s so great about RhostMUSH

1.1.3 Wizard and Immortals by default
-------------------------------------

        * are spoofable.  Meaning all their @pemits by default will not
          trigger NOSPOOF. If you do not wish this, set the SPOOF flag
          this applies to anyone below their level.

        * override all locks.  There’s two flags to disable this.
          NO_OVERRIDE to stop overriding all locks (including attribs)
          and NO_USELOCK to just stop overriding uselocks.  This applies
          to anything their level and lower.

        * optionally cloak from all non-immortals/God player.  This can
          be highly abused if not careful and there is a @depower to
          disable cloaking and/or dark that will disable this.

        * immortals can optionally supercloak from even wizards.  this
          can not be disabled, and you must consider that immortals
          should be treated as the God player (#1) since they are
          effectively #1 in nearly every way.

The flexibility to customize RhostMUSH is what is most daunting.  Don’t
fret, you don’t need to do it to run RhostMUSH successfully.  In fact,
the default configuration is mostly compatible with MUSH and will work
correctly out of the box for most needs.  For those wishing to play, of
course the sky is the limit of what you want to do.

1.1.23.1 Debugging/Tracing
..........................

        * Debugging in Rhost allows for advanced features like
          expressing where and when to do debugging via a trace()
          function, with toggled labels, and the ability to grep content
          from trace output.  There also exists features to color-match
          parenthesis, braces, and brackets in-game as well as pretty
          print the output of commands and functions.  - help trace -
          help %_ - help trace() - help parenmatch() - help parenstr()

1.1.23.2 Zoning
...............

        * Zoning in Rhost allows the same functionality of Penn and MUX,
          though the syntax is different.  It also allows the ability to
          belong to multiple zones at the same time and take advantage
          of mulitple zones at once.  This allows for increased levels
          of complexity.  - help zones - help @zone - help zonecmd() -

1.1.23.3 Reality Levels
.......................

        * Reality levels allows for the ability to have a sandboxed
          ‘existance’ in each physical location across the entirity of
          the mush.  Each reality is its own sandbox and can either
          stand alone or work dependently with other realities.  A
          person can belong to multiple realities at the same time, and
          realities is geared to a method for send and receive.  Each
          ‘method’ requires to be in the given reality to affect it.  -

1.1.23.4 Function and Command Overriding
........................................

        * Functions and commands can both be overridden with softcode.
          To override a hardcoded command you first set the command
          ignore.  There are various levels of ignoring so that you
          could have it ignored from mortals but have it executed fine
          for non-mortals.  This allows you to use the actual physical
          command within a softcode override.  You may also use @Hook
          for altering how a command works.  Functions are overridden by
          setting the function in question ignored, then writing a
          softcode alternative that is then executed and fetched
          appropriately.

               Commands:

                       - wizhelp @admin

                       - wizhelp access

1.1.23.5 The Recycle Bin
........................

        * Rhost has a recycle bin that works a bit like a windows
          recycle bin.  Whenever you destroy something within the mush,
          it is stacked onto the recycle bin and marked unavailable
          within the mush.  This marks the dbref# as garbage in any
          sense of the word.  However, the object is not able to be
          reused until purged.  Once purged, it is put onto a free list
          that can then be reassigned to a new object.  - wizhelp @nuke

1.1.23.6 Percent Substitution Adding/Overriding
...............................................

        * Rhost allows the ability to both override percent
          substitutions as well as creating new ones.  This is done with
          @Hook and admin params and issues softcode overriding.  Due to
          how it is evaluated there is no risk of recursion.  - wizhelp

1.1.23.8 Command based uselocks
...............................

        * This allows you to have unique uselocks per $command.  This is
          done through the use of the USELOCK attribute flag, then you
          set up a matching attribute name with a prefix of a ~ to
          specify how the lock is to be evaluated.  This works in the
          same manner as an evaluation lock.  To be able to use the
          USELOCK attribute flag you must be empowered to do so with the
          ‘ATRUSE’ @toggle.  You may also use the secure_atruselock
          config parameter to globally enable this and not require the
          toggle to be set.  - wizhelp atruse toggle - help attribute

1.1.23.9 Differentating between command and listen locks
........................................................

        * We distinguish between commands and listens with uselocks by
          passing an optional argument to all locks that are uselocks.
          This optional argument is 0 for a default lock, 1 for a
          command lock and 2 for a listen lock.  - help @lock type

.....................................................

        * By default wizards override all locks, including attribute
          locks, can see all dark exits, and bypass pagelocks.  This can
          be troublesome, and even abusive, so there’s ways to disable
          this.  - wizhelp @depower (for those abusing it) - wizhelp

1.1.23.11 Advanced FLAG and TOGGLE control
..........................................

        * Flags and toggles can be controlled to have multiple
          permissions and enable/disable targets of how the flags are
          allowed to be set.  This is done through commands in-game or
          you can use conf file options to do so.  - wizhelp @flagdef -

...............................

        * We allow advanced site control by not only blocking various
          sites but we can specify how many times a player can be
          connected at the same time as well as how many times sites are
          able to connect at the same time.  This is done through normal
          site manipulation.  - wizhelp forbid_host - wizhelp

        * Autoregistration is the method that a player can auto-register
          by providing their email on the connect screen.  It will email
          them a password and an optional document that the
          administrator provides.  This is well described in the

1.1.23.14 Which bit level is best?
..................................

        * This is something that should be discussed by you and the
          staff of your game.  As a good rule of thumb, only provide the
          bitlevel that is required to do the job.  Too much power is
          always risky.  In essence, each tier of bit can do everything
          the previous bitlevel can do, and then additional stuff on top
          of it.  The highest bitlevel is #1 itself, being bitlevel 7.
          Then immortal, which should be considered the #1 character in
          most cases and is bitlevel 6.  Then the royalty character,
          which is equal to wizard on penn, mux, or other codebases.
          For most things, this is the bitlevel you want to assign
          players.  The exception will likely be game owners or people
          who control the master room code.

          There’s a bunch of readme files and online wizhelp that goes
          into detail of the various bitlevels and what each can do.  -

1.1.23.15 What are the limits for size/growth for RhostMUSH?
............................................................

        * While using QDBM, there’s really no set limits for most
          things.  The limits that we have are as followed: LBUF - 64K.
          It is recommended to only use 32K as there is some

                    issues with networking with 64K lbufs.

                  - Compile time option with the menu configurator

          SBUF - 64 characters (if configured – it’s suggested you do).

                  - Compile time option with the menu configurator

          MBUF - 200 characters.  Not able to be changed.

          MAX CONNECTIONS - Limited by the total number of open sockets

                    and descriptors on the account and server running
                    on.  There are various tools to limit connection DoS
                    attemps and other such nastiness.  This is well
                    documented in the netrhost.conf file.

                  - wizhelp max_players

                  - ~/game/netrhost.conf

          MEMORY - no limit. Generally runs between 8-50M depending

               on the size of the mush and the LBUF size specified.

          CPU - no limit, but has built in cpu abort in code. The

                    netrhost.conf file documents this well for
                    customizing.  the default values are usually good
                    enough.

                  - wizhelp max_cpu_cycles

                  - wizhelp cpuintervalchk

                  - ~/game/netrhost.conf

          DISK - no limit. Generally will be 75-200M depending on size,

               number of backups and if you leave your compiled object
               files in.

          DB Size - (20000 default) There is no limit on the number of

                    objects the db can have.  By default it’s soft
                    limited to 20K objects, which can be changed by a
                    netrhost.conf file change.  We have had this up past
                    1.5 million objects, and other than a second or two
                    of lag for complex searches we had no real problem.

                  - wizhelp @quota

                  - wizhelp @limit

          Attribute Size - 10K as a hard limit. 750 as a soft limit.

                    You can increase this but it can’t exceed 10000
                    attributes.  This is to avoid DoS style attacks.

......................................................

        * Both of these can be configured separately or conjointly to
          run in parallel.  This can be done through the RhostMUSH
          configuration utility.  You generally want to use SQL for
          external data storage or accessing a central repository of
          data to share between multiple projects.  Like, for example
          between a wiki, a forum, and the mush.

1.1.23.17 Executing outside scripts and binaries within RhostMUSH
.................................................................

        * Rhost has execscript() which allows executing outside binaries
          or scripts as a native function.  All effort has been done to
          avoid any type of DoS based issue or hang by doing this,
          however the guidelines presented should be followed before
          doing so.  - wizhelp execscript - wizhelp power execscript -

1.1.23.18 Pulling external data into RhostMUSH
..............................................

        * You are capable of pulling external data in to RhostMUSH using
          several methods.  These are by using:

                  - SQL (mysql or sqlite)

                  - execscript

                  - cron (wizhelp signal)

1.1.23.19 Integrating a unix cron right into RhostMUSH
......................................................

        * The unix cron can be used to integrate with Rhost fairly
          easilly by use of signals.  By using SIGUSR1 you can specify
          Rhost to execute code in-game, which part of that could be to
          pick up a pre-designed list of commands that the unix cron has
          set up.  - wizhelp signal - wizhelp signal_cron

1.1.23.20 Signal handling, how it works, and when and why use it
................................................................

        * Signals are used to do different things for the mush.  By
          default, the following signals are recognized by the mush and
          will do the following as defaults.  - SIGUSR1 - will do a
          reboot of the mush.  This is also customizable

               so that you can have it execute code in-mush if you want.

             - SIGUSR2 - will do a clean shutdown of the mush.

             - 
               SIGTERM - will immediately scram the mush as cleanly and fast

                    as possible.  It will avoid dumping anything to the
                    database to speed up scramming, but write a TERM
                    flat file to be loaded in if corruption.

1.1.23.21 Setting up global parents, global @parents, global attribute formatting, and other global setups
..........................................................................................................

        * Global parents are useful when you want to have a global
          ‘parent’ without actually having a defined ‘@parent
          <'@parent>’.  It always will be the highest tier in a lookup.
          The way lookups will go will be:

               self->@parent(s)->@zone(s)->GlobalParent

          The type of the parent does not have to match the target.

          These global parents can be defined either by using a global
          generic parent or by using the type.  If a type is specified
          it overrides the generic.  The following parameters are used:
          - global_parent_obj - The generic global parent (if defined) -
          global_parent_room - The room global parent -
          global_parent_exit - The exit global parent -
          global_parent_thing - The thing global parent -
          global_parent_player - The player global parent

        * Global @parents are different than global parents in that any
          new item of similar type that is created is automatically
          assigned this physical @parent.  It’s obviously more limiting
          since it sets the literal physical parent defined.

          The type of the parent does not have to match the target.

          The following parameters are used: - room_parent - The target
          that new rooms are @parented - exit_parent - The target that
          new exits are @parented - thing_parent - The target that new
          things are @parented - player_parent - The target that new
          players are @parented

        * Global attribute formatting is a method define a wrapper, of
          sorts, where attributes like @desc, @odesc, @succ, and
          anything similar can be processed through this.  All
          attributes will be either &FORMAT<attribute> or
          &<attribute>FORMAT based on the current configuration.
          Example: &FORMATDESC or &DESCFORMAT localy, or use the
          following global objects for global formatting.  Local
          formatting has priority.

          The type of the parent does not have to match the target.

             - room_attr_default - Target for room formatting

             - exit_attr_default - Target for exit formatting

             - thing_attr_default - Target for thing formatting

             - player_attr_default - Target for player formatting

1.1.23.22 RhostMUSH limitations and how to get around them
..........................................................

     While Rhost is insanely configurable and quite powerful, there are
     limitations that exist within it.

        * Function invocations.  Sometimes you will hit a ceiling on
          evaluation.  You may want to tweak values to allow more
          functions or commands to execute.  The following controls
          that: - function_invocation_limit [25000 default] - specifies
          the total

               functions you can execute per command.

             - 
               function_recursion_limit [50] - specifies the total times a

                    function can call itself over and over.  Rarely
                    should this be increased and doing so can effect
                    your stack depth.

        * Command queue limits.  Sometimes you want more to be queued up
          for players or wizards.  - player_queue_limit - Max number of
          entries a player can queue - wizard_queue_limit - Max number
          of entries a wizard can queue

        * @limit is a wonderful way to lock down limitations per player
          or global.  Lots of power is available here.  - @limit -
          vattr_limit_checkwiz - Enable @limit checks for wizards -
          wizmax_vattr_limit - Set wizard global VATTR limits -
          wizmax_dest_limit - Set wizard global @destroy limits -
          max_vattr_limit - Set player global VATTR limits -
          max_dest_limit - Set player global @destroy limits

        * Lots of trace output can be cut off.  You can modify this
          with: - trace_output_limit - Set lines of trace output shown

        * To define how many commands a minute a player set SPAMMONITOR
          can use - spam_limit – default 120

        * If you examine things and see ‘Output cut off’ messages, you
          may want to increase your output limit, funny enough, the name
          of this is similar - output_limit - You should set this no
          less than 4 times the current

               size of your LBUF.

        * Attributes names can not exceed 64 characters.  Sorry, it’s a
          hard limit

        * Sometime you may find a single may not work for an escape.
          You can in most cases use a % instead or double escape the to
          make it work.  Also look at lit() as a solution.

1.1.23.24 PennMUSH
..................

        - Attribute trees.  These are emulated as a base set and can be
          duplicated enough to at least port code.

        - lsearch() will have to be recoded to search()

        - align() will have to be recoded to printf()

        - Penn allows empty attributes.  Rhost does not.  Work will have
          to be done to take this into consideration.

        - All >>*<<val() functions in Penn that are used will have to be
          remapped to a non->>*<<val() function.  It should be as simple
          as function_alias to the non->>*<<val.  Example:

               @admin function_alias=hasattrval hasattr

        - Penn’s hardcoded comsystem is emulated with the softcode
          comsys

        - Penn’s @mail system is workable with mail wrappers

        - Pueblo is not supported.

        - json is not supported.

        - ssl is not natively supported (yet), see section XIV

        - This uses @shutdown/restart, Rhost uses @reboot

        - Mux has an async mysql database engine.  This is not possible
          with Rhost.  You’ll have to use the sync method instead.

        - UTF8 is supported but internally passed differently.

        - Mux’s hardcoded comsystem is emulated with the softcode comsys

        - MUX’s @mail system is workable with mail wrappers

        - Pueblo is not supported.

..............................

        * After you set up your guests, you can set unique names to each
          guest if you so want after defining the dbref#’s your guests
          use.  This is done by defining them in the guest_namelist
          parameter.  You can also increase guests (or decrease them)
          between 0-31 guests.  - wizhelp guest_namelist - wizhelp

..........................................................................

        * Attribute contentlocks can be set up so you can lock the
          actual content that you can set (or even unset!)  into an
          attribute.  The beauty of this is that you can specify case
          sensitive information, lock different ways contents in
          attributes are set based on who is setting it, or even on
          where it’s being set.  The sky’s the limit.  -

1.1.23.28 The amazing @cluster and what it can do for you
.........................................................

        * Clusters is the way to virtually assign multiple objects into
          a single physical object.  It essentially chains together two
          or more objects to share attributes between them, so that any
          attribute set on any object in that cluster can be set or
          fetched as if it was a singular entity.  This allows some
          amazing ability to distribute attribute content or even have a
          farm of a massive amount of attributes without paying a hefty
          penalty on object bloat.

               work.

1.1.24.1 Note on bits, their levels, and things they do
.......................................................

     IMMORTAL - They can do anything.  Treat this as #1 and only give to
     people you trust.  Period.  You don’t have to use this bit if you
     do not want to and just assume #1.

     ROYALTY - Unlike PENN/MUX, this is `not' a sub-wizard, this is a
     FULL wizard.  Plus, they can do a bit more.

     COUNCILOR - Like royalty on PENN/MUX but they can modify.

     ARCHITECT - Can’t do as much as councilor, but lot more than
     BUILDER.

     GUILDMASTER - Very limited.  Sees dbrief#’s, can ex things their
     level and lower and @quota players.

1.1.24.2 You need to @pcreate your guest characters and set them GUEST
......................................................................

     It doesn’t create them on the fly but we considered this better.
     You have 31 total you can have.  It defaults to 10 in the
     netrhost.conf file.  You can rename the guests anything you want,
     but before you do so, you must add the dbref#’s to the param

1.1.24.3 @powers are INHERITED
..............................

     Therefore, you need power_objects enabled (@admin)

          to make this work properly for non-plauyers.  A power is taken
          before a bit level ONLY if higher than that bit.  Yes, powers
          are multi-level.

The largest end user experience will mostly resolve around some look and
feel.  The general look and feel of how to set attributes, work with
commands and functions, and getting around a grid will be identical
between the mush flavors.  @nuke and @destroy will work somewhat
differently between the three codebases and some effort should be looked
at on how different it behaves.

   - The @mail system is different to MUX and Rhost.

   - Debugging code uses DEBUG and has an indented format.

   - The parser for code doesn’t require nested escaping like other
     codebases, but has issues with the pre-parser and nesting.

   - All standard movement, attribute setting, other should be similar

   - Penn allows empty attributes.

   - Penn supports attribute trees.

   - Penn has the standard set of bitlevel flags with on/off @powers

   - The @mail system is unique to MUX/TinyMUSH3 and is not compatible
     with Penn.

   - Debugging uses TRACE and is the old standard for debugging.

   - The parser requires extra escaping for nested escaping but handles

   - MUX does not allow empty attributes.

   - MUX does not support attribute trees.

   - MUX has the standard set of bitlevel flags with on/off @powers

1.2.1.3 RhostMUSH
.................

   - The comsystem (softcode) is in the Mushcode directory and is
     compatible to both PennMUSH and MUX.

   - The mail system is unique to Rhost but there exists mail wrappers
     that allow MUX and Penn compatibility.

   - Debugging uses TRACE and is the old standard for debugging.  It
     allows advanced features like labeling and grepping for content.

   - The parser requires extra escaping for nested escaping but handles
     pre-parsing and nesting fine.

   - Rhost does not allow empty attributes.

   - Rhost marginally supports attribute trees.

   - Rhost has a multi-level set of bitlevel flags with multi-tier
     @powers, @depowers, and varying other tools for permissions.

1.2.2 Comparison of features between RhostMUSH, PennMUSH, and MUX2
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are differences in the initial set up from Rhost to PennMUSH (and
MUX2).

A lot of people use PennMUSH and if you are one of them, this may help
you.  Some people use MUX2, hopefully this will help you as well.

NOTE: If you plan to use sideeffects, you must set the SIDEFX flag to allow

     the target to use it

NOTE: Rhost does support UNICODE/UTF8, but it’s currently not part of the main

     branch as of this writing.  Please talk to Kage on the dev site for
     more information on when it’ll be released.

1.2.3 Organization of help and wizhelp
--------------------------------------

First, on PennMUSH, help is separated into ‘help’ and ‘wizhelp’.  This
can be confusing.  If you want to ‘combine’ them, you may use the
following snippit:

$ahelp*:@pemit
%#=[switch([!!words(%0)][match(/search,%0*)],0?,[setq(0,help)][setq(1,0)],11,[setq(0,rest(%0))][setq(1,2)],setq(0,trim(%0)))][setq(a,textfile(help,%q0,%q1))][setq(b,textfile(wizhelp,%q0,%q1))][setq(2,)][ifelse(!strmatch(%qa,No
entry*),%qa[setq(2,%r)])][ifelse(!strmatch(%qb,No
entry*),%q2%qb[setq(2,%r)])][ifelse(!$r(2),No topics found for ‘%q0’.)]

This will display help from help and wizhelp for any matching topic.  It
should make life easier for you.  This also honors the /search switch.

1.2.4 Mail, comsystem, guests, master rooms, etc..
--------------------------------------------------

The comsystem is softcode and included in the readme directory.
(comsys).  Just load it in.  The mail wrappers can be gotten from:

     The Mushcode directory in the Rhost Distribution.

Please see the other readme files on setting other things up like
guests, master rooms, and so forth.

1.2.14 What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH, TinyMUSH2, TinyMUSH3, or MUX2 to work on Rhost
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RhostMUSH, for the most part, will work out of the box with most
softcode gotten from other codebases.  There are, however, exceptions.
Most of these exceptions will be minor code differences between how ANSI
is processed, the variences of arguments or switches to commands or
functions, or required flags.

Most changes will revolve around the ones listed in this document.

1.2.14.2 Problematic features between codebases
...............................................

named variables for regexp patterns in $commands are not supported.
@aliases on non-players are not supported.  Frankly I find them
redundant.

1.2.14.4 SIDEFX flag
....................

     Anything that uses sideeffects –DIRECTLY– requires this flag.
     Sideeffects are like set(), pemit(), and so forth.  list(), while a
     side-effect, does not require this flag as it is considered passive
     and safe.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Variable exits,  Next: Zones,  Prev: SIDEFX flag,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

1.2.14.5 Variable exits
.......................

     Rhost handles them slightly different.  You do not link exits to
     #-4.  That’s an invalid destination.  I always found it, frankly,
     stupid to save any data in the database that was literally invalid.
     So, you link the exit as you normally would, then @toggle the exit
     variable.  At that point you use @exitto like you would any other
     codebase.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Zones,  Next: @powers,  Prev: Variable exits,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

1.2.14.6 Zones
..............

     Zones actually can work near exactly as you would expect them to
     work on TinyMUSH, MUX, or Penn.  Either at once or at different
     times.  We recognize multiple zones, zone masters, zone
     inheritance, zone parenting, zone command processing, and the
     ability to bypass zones entirely.  There’s a ton of flexbility with
     this.  However, the syntax for adding/removing zones is different
     so the commands will have to be ported to Rhost.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: @powers,  Next: Attribute length,  Prev: Zones,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

1.2.14.7 @powers
................

     Powers work a bit differently in Rhost and they’re named
     differently, which should not be that big a surprise as they’re
     different between all the codebases anyway.  The big difference is
     our powers are tiered, meaning the can be limited or grown to a
     given bitlevel and are not just toggle powers like the other
     codebases.  We also have @depower that is the anti-thesis of @power


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Attribute length,  Next: Attribute contents,  Prev: @powers,  Up: What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH TinyMUSH2 TinyMUSH3 or MUX2 to work on Rhost

1.2.14.8 Attribute length
.........................

     While we have 64 character attribute capabilities like most other
     codebases, PennMUSH allows 1024 attribute length attributes.  Why
     you need one that long boggles the mind, but if you do use attribs
     that long you need to make sure they are cut down to the proper
     length.

1.2.14.9 Attribute contents
...........................

     You’ll be happy to know that Rhost allows upwards to 64,000 bytes
     of data to be assigned an LBUF. We strongly recommand to cap at
     32,000 however as the various TCP socket protocols play nicer with
     that value.

1.2.14.11 Unicode/UTF8
......................

     Yup!  We got this too.  Not quiet yet in the main branch, but
     download Kage’s branch, you won’t be dissapointed.  We will have
     UTF8 in Rhost 4.0 when released.

1.2.14.12 Attributes per object
...............................

     This is configurable with the VLIMIT @admin command, however, it is
     absolutely hard-limited at 10000 maximum.  This is to avoid any DoS
     type situation and because frankly there should never be a reason
     to exceed that.  If you need more, use @clusters.

1.2.14.13 Destroying
....................

     @nuke only works on players.  @destroy works on non-players.  Never
     the two will meet.  We also have a built in recycle bin meaning
     anything destroyed will not be automatically recycled.  If you want
     it recycled, you have to @purge it.  Yes, if you use Myrddin’s
     CRON, it has a built in entry to auto-purge anything older than 30
     days.  This also means you can on-line recover anything destroyed
     before that 30 days.  Groovy, eh?

1.2.14.15 lsearch() and search()
................................

     lsearch() in Penn is not syntacically similar to non-Penn search().
     This will have to be altered.  In addition, search() in non-penn
     games have to have special consideration for escaping out the
     evaled args.

1.2.14.16 @locks can be different
.................................

     We have many more lock capabilities and options so this should be a
     non-issue.

1.2.14.17 Customer user-locks
.............................

     We do not have custom user-locks like Penn.  We do, however, have
     the way to set encapsulated lock data into an attribute to fetch
     and compare against which I find more useful and far more flexible.
     See: lockencode(), lockdecode(), and lockcheck()

1.2.14.18 Attribute trees
.........................

     Unlike Penn, we don’t really have attribute trees.  We do support
     the basic capabilities of it for compatibility if you load in
     softcode that uses it, but it doesn’t have the advanced features of
     attribute trees.  Please see ‘help attribute tree’ for more
     information.

1.2.14.19 Prefix permission locking
...................................

     We do allow prefix permission locking, and some very advanced
     abilities of it.  Please see wizhelp on @aflags for more

1.2.14.20 align() and printf()
..............................

     We do not have align().  Most of the code that uses align() will
     have to be converted to our printf() (which is compatible but has
     different syntax)

1.2.14.24 Various Functions
...........................

     There is a ‘softcode.minmax’ in the Mushcode directory that loads
     up a slew of @function wrappers that will emulate various functions
     that MUX, Penn, or TM3 has.  We have the functionality for nearly
     all of them, but either our functions have different syntax, or we
     have different named functions that duplicate the functionality.
     It would be far better to recode it to use the native functions,
     but the @function wrappers are there for lazyness :)

1.2.14.25 Empty Attributes
..........................

     Penn allows you to have empty attributes.  Non-penn codebases do
     not.  Thus, hasattrval and the like are not needed and should
     likely just point to hasattr instead.

1.2.14.26 Player Stats
......................

     MUX has some built in ways for player stats.  We do as well but
     they’re either done via functions or attribute contents.  Code that

1.2.15.1 PennMUSH
.................

   - Attribute trees.  These are emulated as a base set and can be
     duplicated enough to at least port code.

   - lsearch() will have to be recoded to search()

   - align() will have to be recoded to printf()

   - Penn allows empty attributes.  Rhost does not.  Work will have to
     be done to take this into consideration.  - All >>*<<val()
     functions in Penn that are used will have to be remapped to a
     non->>*<<val() function.  It should be as simple as function_alias
     to the non->>*<<val.  Example: @admin function_alias=hasattrval
     hasattr

   - Penn’s hardcoded comsystem is emulated with the softcode comsys

   - Penn’s @mail system is workable with mail wrappers

   - Pueblo is not supported.

   - json is not supported.

   - ssl is not natively supported (yet).

   - This uses @shutdown/restart, Rhost uses @reboot

1.3.2 Requirements
------------------

RhostMUSH is a Linux or Unix based server software that runs as a daemon
on the host.  In order to build this software, you will need the bare
minimum of the ability to run ‘make’ commands.  Package requirements are
as follows: * glibc and gcc/clang (compiling the code) * git (to clone
the source and maintain patches) * bash/ksh/dash (or compatible shell -
for use with build menu) * libcrypt (for password encryption - this is
usually standard on unix based systems)

RhostMUSH also offers optional linking and library attachments.  For
some of these libraries it will attempt to do auto-detection, but in a
worse case scenario, there exists override hashes in the menu to disable
options it thinks exist that do not.  Optional packages are as follows:
* openssl dev libraries/headers (for MUX password compatibility, and
digest() and advanced cryptology functionality.  * mysql client &
mysql_config (required for mysql capabilities) * sqlite3 libraries
(required for sqlite capabilities) * ruby/perl/python/etc (for custom
interactive dynamic custom functions with the execscript() feature) *
libpcre (if you wish to use system pcre libraries instead of the
built-in ones)


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Hosting Requirements,  Prev: Requirements<2>,  Up: Requirements

1.3.3 Hosting Requirements
--------------------------

You will need a stable host and access to open a single port number of
your choice on the firewall.  Most games choose a number between 1025
and 9999, by convention.  Please make sure your debug_id matches the
port number + 5.  So if your port is 1234, your debug_id will be 12345.
The debug_id is for use in the API daemon that runs Rhost as a container
to keep track of heap, stack, and execution location.

1.4.1 Compiling the code
------------------------

make confsource

Yes, that’s all you have to do.

You may also issue ‘make source’ if the Makefile is already defined how
you want it to be.  Please remember to ‘make clean’ before ‘make source’
whenever you alter the code or import new source code.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Note about Compiling,  Next: Note about Recompiling,  Up: Compiling the code

1.4.1.1 Note about Compiling
............................

To install, type: make confsource

If your binaries do not work or you get an error type:
./bin/script_setup.sh Then type: make confsource

If you are importing a MUX2 flatfile, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that you
select mux passwords as a compatibility option, or you will NOT BE ABLE
to log in to players as the password will not be recognizeable.

Make sure to keep QDBM selected as it’s a much more stable database
engine that does not have attribute limit restrictions like GDBM does.

If you are converting from a Penn, TinyMUSH, or MUX database, make sure
you drill down into the LBUF section and select, at minimum, 8K lbufs.
You likely want that anyway as it gives you far more room for attribute
content storage.

You can go up to 32K safely.  While 64k is safe and does work, there are
issues with networking and older routers that use a 32K TCP buffer size
that can at times cut off the data as overflow resulting in output to
the end-point players not receiving their data.  So it is strongly
recommended not to go above 32K in lbuffer size.

Go ahead and select 64 char attributes.  It allows you to have 64
characters for attribute names.  It’s handy to have.

If you wish at this point to set up mysql and/or sqlite, you may do so.
Yes, you can use them in parallel without any issue.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Note about Recompiling,  Next: Note about Patching,  Prev: Note about Compiling,  Up: Compiling the code

1.4.1.2 Note about Recompiling
..............................

If you plan to use ‘make confsource’ to recompile your source, you
should first issue a ‘make clean’ before re-issuing a ‘make confsource’.
‘make confsource’ remembers the last options you used.

A failure to issue ‘make clean’ prior to re-compiling with ‘make
confsource’ or re-compiling with ‘make source’ can potentially leave
stale object files which may cause unforseen issues when running code,
including but not limited to random crashes.  Generally whenever
recompiling it’s good to always make clean first.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Note about Patching,  Prev: Note about Recompiling,  Up: Compiling the code

1.4.1.3 Note about Patching
...........................

There’s two ways you can look to patch the source.  If you plan to run
the RhostMUSH source from a git repository, then please use the git repo
to constantly update your code.  If you knew enough to want to set up a
git repo then we expect knowledge on how to keep source trees updated in
the git repo to be used the same as any other source distribution.

If, however, you have no idea what a git repo even is, or have no
inclination of using git to manage your RhostMUSH source, or just don’t
care one way or another, then you can use the included patch.sh routine
(from under the Server directory) to patch your source at any time.

From the server directory just type: ./patch.sh

That will auto-compile your source, auto make all your header files and
essentially keep everything up to date to the latest source.  Once
that’s done, all you do from within the game is two commands:

  1. @reboot (or @reboot/silent) – This will load in the new binary

  2. @readcache – This will read in all the .txt file changes

1.4.2 Configuring the game
--------------------------

When setting up a mush for the first time, make sure you have all the
files configured correctly.  This is with using the following file for
configuration:

        - netrhost.conf


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Starting the game,  Next: First login to the game,  Prev: Configuring the game,  Up: Installation

1.4.3 Starting the game
-----------------------

Once done, you start up the system with the following command:

        - [sh/csh] ./Startmush

     It will prompt you to start a new db if it doesn’t find one.

     You may also do the commands individually: - [csh] netrhost -s
     netrhost.conf >& netrhost.log &

          [sh] netrhost -s netrhost.conf > netrhost.log 2>&1 &

1.4.4 First login to the game
-----------------------------

Once started, log in the #1 character (Wizard) with it’s appropiate
password (no, not ‘potrzebie’, but ‘Nyctasia’).  There were private
reasons for the password change.

Once in, do a @shutdown to save the database.  Then you can run Startup
normally.  You may make a backup of your database at anytime on-line by
utilizing the @dump/flat option.  A script comes with this distribution
that allows the ability of auto-archiving your database for a
configurable number of backups.

------------------------------------------

To begin, you will run the following command in a directory that will
house your game:

     > `git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost'

You may also just run the yml file and ansible (ansible-playbook) to install your RhostMUSH engine

     > `wget
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RhostMUSH/trunk/master/rhostinstall.yml'

     > `ansible-playbook rhostinstall.yml'

...........................

It is assumed that you have gotten to this point with the following
command:

git clone ‘https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk’ Rhost

If you did NOT get it this way, your file permissions may not be
properly set up.  Please type:

     chmod +rx bin/`.sh src/'.sh game/`.sh game/Startmush game/db_'

This makes sure all the build scripts are properly made executable.
This will result in ‘permission denied’ or similar results when running
a script.

Once ready to compile type:

     make confsource

This will bring up a menu where you can selection options.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Important before you actually start building,  Next: Using the prebuilt flatfile,  Prev: Obtaining RhostMUSH,  Up: Quickinstall guide to RhostMUSH

1.4.7.2 Important before you actually start building
....................................................

The main parts of making your RhostMUSH, easy pleasy: 0.  The stunnel
directory contains TLS/SSL connectivity.  This has to be linked

     to another port and will tunnel to the mush port.  The README file
     explains how to set up and configure your TLS/SSL connection.

  1. ./patch.sh – This makes sure you have the latest code.  If you got
     this by git clone ‘https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk’ then you can
     ignore patching.  You can use ./patch.sh at any time to update your
     code.  It ignores local.c incase you make your own modules.

  2. make confsource.  Yup, it’s menu driven, nifty eh?  Options you may
     want to select (other than the defaults): 5 (%c is selected by
     default, but choose %x as well for MUX/TM3 compat) 9 (if you want
     $commands to require the COMMAND flag) 16 (if you want a wider WHO
     listing like older versions of MUX) 22 (if you’re converting a
     TinyMUSH3 or TinyMUX/MUX2 flatfile) 24 (if you have issues with
     -lssl not being found) B3 (for 64 character attribute names) B6
     (select 8K for Penn/MUX2/TM3 default, up to 32K. 64K is network
     intensive) B5 (will be autoselected if you choose 8K or more.  Pick
     this anyway) B4 (if you have sqlite libraries and wish to use this)

  3. ‘r’ to compile with the settings you selected.

  4. Modify your netrhost.conf file as specified.  Make sure to align
     your port and debug_id as shown in the netrhost.conf file.

  5. If you wish to port in an old flatfile, please refer to the readme
     directory on how to port your flatfile in (README.DBLOADING).


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Using the prebuilt flatfile,  Next: Starting from scratch with a brand new database,  Prev: Important before you actually start building,  Up: Quickinstall guide to RhostMUSH

1.4.7.3 Using the prebuilt flatfile
...................................

There are pre-loaded flatfile databases you can use at this point.  The
netrhost.db.flat and corrisponding netrhost.conf file will be located in
the minimal-DBs/minimal_db directory.

You may auto-load the minimal db and corresponding netrhost.conf file
with the command:

     ./minimal.sh

This is ran from within the ‘game’ directory.  Once this is ran, you
will need to customize the netrhost.conf file for your purposes.  The
port and debug_id must be changed at the very least.  Keep the debug_id
coordinated to the port as described.

* Menu:

* To load a prebuilt flatfile::


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: To load a prebuilt flatfile,  Up: Using the prebuilt flatfile

1.4.7.4 To load a prebuilt flatfile
...................................

To use these follow these steps: 1.  Make a backup of your existing
netrhost.conf file

     –> cp game/netrhost.conf game/netrhost.conf.backup

  2. Copy the netrhost.conf file into your game directory –> cp -f
     ./minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.conf ./game/netrhost.conf

  3. At this point you can modify your netrhost.conf file settings in
     your game directory.  Using an editor modify the ‘port’ and
     ‘debug_id’ respectively in your netrhost.conf as stated.  The
     ‘port’ will be the port the mush listens on, the debug_id is for
     the debug-stack and is your port with a ‘5’ at the end.  So if your
     port is 4444, the debug_id is 44445

  4. Load in the flatfile into the mush (You could do this in the
     Startmush as well) Manually: –> cd game –> ./db_load
     data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat
     data/netrhost.db.new

     Start your mush: –> ./Startmush

     This will load the db that you loaded.

     —————OR——-

     From Startmush: –> ./Startmush

     when prompted, hit <RETURN> for searching then select the number of
     the netrhost.db.flat that is listed as
     ~/minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat

1.4.7.5 Starting from scratch with a brand new database
.......................................................

  1. You can modify your netrhost.conf file settings in your game
     directory.  Using an editor modify the ‘port’ and ‘debug_id’
     respectively in your netrhost.conf as stated.  The ‘port’ will be
     the port the mush listens on, the debug_id is for the debug-stack
     and is your port with a ‘5’ at the end.  So if your port is 4444,
     the debug_id is 44445

  2. Start your mush: –> ./Startmush

You can use the ‘vi’ editor or ‘nano’ if you like a more menu driven DOS
like experience.  You can of course use any other editor you’re familar
with.

For a more thorough understanding of how to set things up, keep reading!

If you have syntax issues running ‘make config’, ‘make confsource’ or

               work: TINY_U, USE_SIDEEFFECTS, MUX_INCDEC, ATTR_HACK

                    (u()/u2() switched) (sideeffects) (inc()/xinc()
                    switched) (support for _/~ attribs)

               You only need to do this if you received the RhostMUSH
               src.  If you received a binary, continue on to the next
               part.

               To compile the code, just type ‘make confsource’.  It
               will prompt you with settings on what you need to do.  If
               you just want to quickly hand edit the Makefile, it is in
               the directory src (full path src/Makefile).  Then you may
               just run ‘make source’, if you so choose to hand-edit the
               Makefile.

     After the compile process is done, type ‘make links’!

............................................................................................

       a. @dig your master room and in your netrhost.conf file define
          master_room to this dbref (without the #.  So like master_room
          2)

       b. Create an immortal holder charater (@pcreate then @set
          immortal) Feel free to set up holder characters for all the
          bittypes which are:

               GUILDMASTER, ARCHITECT, COUNCILOR, WIZARD, IMMORTAL

       c. @chown/preserve the master room and #0 to the immortal holder
          character.

       d. Log into the immortal character

       e. @pcreate all your guest characters and set them up properly.
          My suggestion: @dolist lnum(1,10)={@pcreate Guest##=guest;@set
          >>*<<Guest##=guest;@desc >>*<<Guest##=A guest
          player.;@adisconnect >>*<<Guest##=home;@lock
          >>*<<Guest##=*Guest##}

          @list guest will show your guest characters and if they’re set
          up properly.

       f. Any master room code you load in from your immholder character
          (or @chown/preserve to it) The readme directory has
          softfunctions.minmax that has MUX/Penn compatability functions
          and comsys.  All other softcode (like mail wrappers) can be
          found on ‘http://code.google.com/p/rhostmush’ in downloads.

1.4.7.16 Setup daily backups for your game
..........................................

     Make SURE YOU RUN DAILY Backups.  Rhost is very stable, but things
     outside the mush can damage the game.  paranoia is fine, especially
     when they really are out to get you.  TO make the backups, do the
     following:

     @dump/flat – This makes a flatfile dump of the main database.  You
     want to run this daily.  wmail/unload – This makes a flatfile dump
     of the mail database.  You want to run this daily.  @areg/unload –
     Only worry about this if you are using auto-registration emailing.
     Few do.  newsdb/unload – Only worry if you use the hardcoded bbs
     system.  Most don’t use it.

     The backup_flat.sh script (that launches automatically with
     Startmush) will archive all the above files if they exist.  It
     moves these flatfiles into the ‘prevflat’ directory, then tarballs
     those and dumps consecutive backups in the ‘oldflat’ directory.  By
     default it keeps 7 consecutive backups.  You may alter this in the
     backup_flat.sh script itself.

1.4.8.1 Creating a new game with a blank database
.................................................

     Modify your ./game/netrhost.conf file or what settings you want.
     Don’t feel overwhelmed, it’s all very well documented.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Creating a new game with Ambrosia’s default database,  Next: Creating a new game with the generic default database,  Prev: Creating a new game with a blank database,  Up: What to type to configure and get your RhostMUSH up and running

1.4.8.2 Creating a new game with Ambrosia’s default database
............................................................

     Follow minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/IMPORTANT_README

     The netrhost.conf file you will copy is in
     minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/game Copy this netrhost.conf file into
     your ‘game’ directory.

     You will want the custom txt files under Amb-MinimalRhost/txt in
     your game/txt directory and to mkindx all the txt files.  You can
     run ./Startmush -i to index.

     When ./Startmush prompts you to load a flatfile, say ‘yes’ and hit
     <RETURN> to have it search for flatfiles, then select
     netrhost.db.flat from under the minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost
     directory.

     The main steps to make sure you do for Ambrosia’s db:
     ~/Server/minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/netrhost.db.flat – Ambrosia’s
     secure and featured minimal db.

             - Use the matching netrhost.conf file under the
               Amb-MinimalRhost/game directory

             - Load in the settings specified in the
               Amb-MinimalRhost/bin directory.  - Copy this file into
               your ~/Server/bin directory - From ‘Server’ directory
               type: make clean - From ‘Server’ directory type: make
               confsource and ‘l’oad option 0 - Specify any -additional-
               options you want at this point.  - Recompile your code

             - Copy the files in Amb-MinimalRhost/game/txt into your
               ~/Server/game/txt directory

             - from your ~/Server/game txt file run on each of the txt
               files: ../mkindx <txtfile>.txt <txtfile>.indx Where
               <txtfile> is the name of the file (minus the .txt
               extension)

             - If running, @reboot your game.

1.4.8.3 Creating a new game with the generic default database
.............................................................

     Copy the netrhost.conf from minimal-DBs/minimal_db to your game
     directory.

     When ./Startmush prompts you to load a flatfile, say ‘yes’ and hit
     <RETURN> to have it search for flatfiles, then select
     netrhost.db.flat from under the minimal-DBs/minimal_db directory.

..........................

Once you have used one of these three methods to obtaina database, you
can start your mush up.  At this point type from the game directory:

     ./Startmush


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Backups for RhostMUSH,  Next: Troubleshooting issues with starting up,  Prev: Starting your MUSH,  Up: What to type to configure and get your RhostMUSH up and running

1.4.8.5 Backups for RhostMUSH
.............................

     Backups are already handled and integrated with a script
     ‘backup_flat.sh’.  If you wish to customize this, feel free.
     Again, it is well documented and just require changing settings at
     the top of this script.

     By default, it does 7 contiguous backups.  You may increase or
     decrease this value to any value you want.

     It will, by default, backup all your txt/`.txt files, your
     netrhost.conf file, your netrhost.db.flat (mush db) file, your
     RhostMUSH.dump.'  (mail db) files, your RhostMUSH.news.* (internal
     news/bbs db – if used), your RhostMUSH.areg.* (the autoregistration
     db – if used), and any sqlite database you currently may be using
     which are OPTIONALLY backed up if you remove the ‘#’ from before
     it.

     The backup script also will optionally rcp/scp, ftp, or mail any
     backups you want to a remote destination.  Be forewarned, the
     backup files can potentially get rather large for larger games,
     even compressed.  The average size for these files will be 1-5MB.
     It could potentially get over 10-20MB in size for excessively large
     games, so plan accordingly.

     Be aware that the backup system will NOT make successful backups if
     you run out of disk space.  This includes actually running out of
     disk space or running out of disk quota.  There is a mechanism
     inside the backup script to specify an email address that you wish
     to get alerts from in these instances.  I recommend using it.

     If you make changes to your backup_flat.sh script with an already
     active and running mush and wish to just restart the backup
     procedure just issue: ./backup_restart.sh

1.4.8.6 Troubleshooting issues with starting up
...............................................

If you run into issues:

     Probelm: If it says the shared ID is already in use

          A1: please verify that it is the right shared debug_id in your

               netrhost.conf file

          A2: Force a start by ./Startmush -f

     Problem: Your log file is massive and your mush is running

          A1: To rotate this use the @logrotate command.

               See wizhelp on @logrotate

     Problem: The database flatfile you’re loading can’t load because

               a db is already defined.

          A1: remove netrhost.db* and netrhost.gdbm* from your data
          directory

     Problem: The mail database won’t load and mail shows ‘offline’

packages: git make gcc openssl (optional) libpcre3 (optional)
libpcre3-dev (optional)

2.  When configuring rhost (using confsource) select the Disable
Debugmon option.

  3. When you issue Startmush, you must pass the -cyg option.

1.5.1 Loading an existing Database
----------------------------------

To load in a previous database, you run the db_load script.

From the game directory you would type:

./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm yourflatfilehere data/netrhost.db.new

* Menu:

........................................................................

If you wish to have #1’s password reset to ‘Nyctasia’ please add this to
the bottom of your netrhost.conf file:

newpass_god 777

The caveat is that you must not have any netrhost.db* or netrhost.gdbm*
files in your data directory prior to loading it in.  It’ll error out if
previous files exist.  So you will need to move all files that start
with netrhost.db* and all files that start with netrhost.gdbm* to
another directory.

Your flatfile tends to be named ‘netrhost.db.flat’ which is in your data
directory.  You can, however, name your flatfile anything you want and
have it in any directory you want.

To make a flatfile in game, you just issue @dump/flat.  You can specify
a filename after it, otherwise it assumes the name ‘netrhost.db.flat’.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH,  Prev: Loading an existing Database,  Up: Database

1.5.2 Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH
---------------------------------------------------------

In the ~/Server/convert directory there is a script called
‘doconvert.sh’

This script will convert most flatfiles from existing mush engines to
RhostMUSH. The exception is PennMUSH 1.8.0 and later.  For this there is
a BETA converter penn18x_converter.tgz.  This is proven to work, most of
the time, with codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not been fully
vetted with the latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies.

To convert a non-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you
first need a valid flatfile of the game you’re wanting to convert.
Please refer to the documentatation of the mush engine in question (MUX,
Penn 1.7, TM2/3) on how to do this.  Once you have it type:

./doconvert.sh FLATFILETOCONVERT FLATFILEOUTPUT

In this instance, FLATFILETOCONVERT will be the filename (with full
path) to the flatfile you are wishing to convert.

The FLATFILEOUTPUT is anyfilename you wish to name the RhostMUSH
converted flatfile.  I suggest netrhost_converted.db.flat so you know by
the name what it is.

Follow what it asks for and just let it do its thing.

     directory off the main Rhost directory.  Filename:
     ~/Rhost/Mushcode/MyrddinCRON

@chown/preserve the myrddin mush cron to immholder, then move to maste room.

     Note: the globalroom() function returns the dbref# of the master

chowning it, and moving to the master room as you did above.

Likewise, any softcode you find on the internet or on other mushes
should be portable to RhostMUSH with little to no changes depending on
the complexity of the code in question.

1.6.2 Minimal DB instructions
-----------------------------

The ‘retired’ directory has older image files if you’re interested

Please use the netrhost.conf file with the database as they’re linked.

The flatfile must be loaded in as a new db

This is a minimal db with basic ‘features’ built in.

Copy the txt files into the Rhost’s txt directory off game.

     cp txt/* ~/Rhost/Server/game/txt

mkindx the files (substitute FILENAME with the filename)

     cd ~/Rhost/Server/game/txt ../mkindx FILENAME.txt FILENAME.indx

Steps: 1) Using the Startmush utility for the first time, select the
load db method

— or —

  1. copy the netrhost.conf file into the games directory

  2. make any relevant changes you wish

  3. db_load the flatfile - go into the game directory - type: ./db_load
     data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat
     data/netrhost.db.new

  4. Startmush as expected

1.6.3.1 Version: 1.0.5 2020-01-31
.................................

Version history:

     1.0.0

             - Initial database setup.

     1.0.1

             - Small fixes of objid(), isstaff() and bccheck()
               permissions and handling.

             - bittype() access lowered to Architect level

             - NO_CODE flag made visual to Architect

     1.0.2

             - Several convenience changes and fixes: _ Attributes moved
               to @aflags system, allowing Architects to set,
               Guildmasters to see them.

             - @flagdef lowered to Royalty level.  @quota/max,
               @quota/unlock and @convert moved to Architect level.

             - NO_CODE flag made settable/unsettable by Architects.

             - Fixed typo in conf file: ifselse -> ifelse

             - Switched _Attributes to use the @aflags system See:
               Guildmaster Set: Architect

     1.0.3

             - Removed @flagdefs from in-game softcode, converted to
               flag_access_* config options

             - Lowered mailstatus() access to architect.

     1.0.4

             - Changed softcoded objid() to tag(), due to Rhost’s new
               hardcoded objid() which does perform a different
               functionality.

             - Added more staff recommendations to this file.

             - Added Reality TXLevel ‘Admin’ to all objects in the db
               except #1

     1.0.5

             - Replaced softcoded tag() system with Rhost’s new
               hardcoded @tag/tag() system.  All previous tags are set
               on the database.  The Tag Object was removed.

             - @function startup on BC-Admin-Royalty fixed - @wait 1
               workaround for Tags in place.

             - Places System @startup integrated into BC-Admin-Royalty’s
               @startup

             - Made @dump and @dump/flat available to Councilors in
               netrhost.conf

     1.0.6

             - A small typo fix in netrhost.conf.  float_preciiosn ->
               precision and functions_max -> function_max.  Thanks to
               <Bobbi@COH>

1.6.3.4 Configuration
.....................

   * Limbo, Master Room and Auxiliary room.

   * BC-Admin-<bitlevel> characters set up for each bitlevel to own
     global and data objects, and inherit to.

   * BC-Admin-Mortal is @powered EXAMINE_ALL(Guildmaster),
     NOFORCE(Architect) and LONG_FINGERS.

   * @startup on BC-Admin-Immortal lowers DARK flag access to Councilor
     level, and NO_CODE visual access to Architect level.

   * Global Command objects inheriting from each bitlevel, with a
     separate staff- -only object for each level.

   * Global Function objects inheriting from each bitlevel.

   * local Function objects inheriting from each bitlevel.

   * @function and @hook access lowered to Royalty level to remove
     immediate need for Immortals or actual Immortal code.

   * @rxlevel, @txlevel, bittype() access lowered to Architect level to
     remove immediate need for Royalty in many cases.

   * @startup on BC-Admin-Royalty to automatically load @hooks and
     @functions from the Global Function objects, based on attribute
     naming.

   * Misc Data object to hold general data, like Staff lists etc.

   * Reality levels ‘Real’ and ‘Admin’.  All created items and players
     by default are in Recieve-Level ‘Real’ and Transmit-Levels ‘Real’
     and ‘Admin’.

   * All globals, Master Room, BCs->>*<<, and other staff/code-related
     objects currently have only ‘Admin’ as their Transmit-Level.  This
     does not prevent them fromi working properly.  The only exception
     is #1, who has empty reality levels.

   * The supplied netrhost.conf offers a secure setup of options, allows
     Royalty to use @hook and @function, and also sets the
     function_access of several functions to !no_code, which allows
     NO_CODE players to use the comsys properly.  IT IS HIGHLY
     RECOMMENDED to use this .conf as a base for this DB. The ‘Port’
     configuration parameter is XXXX’d out.  Set it first before
     starting your game.

   * All existing objects have been @set SAFE and INDESTRUCTABLE.

   * All existing objects have a paranoid series of @locks set on
     themselves.

   * The +supersafe command is provided on #1 as an example of what was
     used to easily set this on objects.

   * Players are @set NO_CODE and WANDERER by default.  They get 40
     credits on creation, and a 1-credit-per-day paycheck.

   * All >>*<<mit sideeffects, as well as set(), create() and list() are
     enabled.  The latter three are necessary for the Comsystem.  The
     rest of sideeffects are disabled completely.

   * Flashing ansi is disabled.

   * _Attributes are settable by Architects, and seeable by
     Guildmasters.  Read: Still invisible and unsettable by mortals.

   * Architects can set up, unlock, and change alternate @quota on
     players.

   * Architects can set/unset the NO_CODE flag.

   * Guildmasters can see _Attributes

   * Architects can set _Attributes

1.6.3.6 Functions
.................

   * isstaff() - Softcoded function that returns ‘1’ if its argument
     matches a #dbref in the ‘isstaff’ attribute on the Misc Data
     object.

   * bccheck() - Softcoded function that returns ‘1’ if its argument
     matches a #dbref in the ‘bcs’ attribute on the Misc Data object.

   * width() - Softcoded function that returns 78 for now.  For
     cross-MU* compatibility.

   * pass() - Softcoded function that takes a number as its parameter,
     and return a random string of that length.  Perfect for setting
     random passwords.

   * cmdmessage() - Softcoded function that takes two strings as its
     parameters.  Returns ‘<< STRING1 >> String2’.  The <<>> part is
     highlighted red.  Good for all kinds of messages sent by game
     commands.

   * header() - Highly versatile, and a buffer-saving alternative to
     using printf() for centering with ansi borders.  HIGHLY recommended
     to use instead of printf() for such things.
     header(text,width,filler,fillercolor,outerpadding,paddingcolor,

               leftinnerpadding,leftinnercolor,rightinnerpadding,rightinnercolor)

          text - Text to center width - Width of the header, defaults to
          width() filler - Character(s) to draw the line with.  Default:
          = fillercolor - ansicode to color the line with outerpadding -
          Characters to frame the outer ends of the line with.
          paddingcolor - ansicode to color the outer characters with
          leftinnerpadding - characters to put at the left side of
          <text> leftinnercolor - ansicode to color the leftside
          characters with rightinnerpadding - characters to put at the
          right side of <text> rightinnercolor - ansicode to color the
          rightside characters with

     ALL of header()’s parameters are optional.  By default, header()
     simply draws a 78-char wide line of =’s.  Simply leave parameters
     empty if you want to set one of the latter parameters.

1.6.3.7 Bitlevels
.................

The whole DB is highly geared for a low-bitlevel setup.  I am a strong
believer in least-privileges-needed to do the job.  Bittypes and powers
are tools to do that job, not badges of friendship or trust that get
tossed about.

Here is my suggested list of powers and bittypes for staffers:

Storytellers - @powered TEL_ANYWHERE, JOIN_PLAYER and GRAB_PLAYER on

     Guildmaster level.

Builder-BCs - Mortal, with @quota and money for their job. There should be one

     shared BC for each area of the game, like BC-Houston.  Special
     Rooms, items or exits that require privilegs to examine or @tel a
     player should belong to a BC-Houston-Powered that is @powered
     EXAMINE_ALL, LONG_FINGERS And TEL_ANYTHING on Guildmaster level.
     If the object actually needs to modify a player directly, have it
     use a restricted staff Global, or if you absolutely must, make a
     BC-Houston-Admin and @set it Architect.  Do not give normal
     builders access to it, only @chown things to it and @set them
     inherit after review.  Both the -powered and -admin BCs can have
     random passwords and be @set NO_CONNECT.

Building Head - @set Guildmaster, powered TEL_ANYWHERE, TEL_ANYTHING and

     optionally CHOWN_OTHER on Guildmaster level.  Mind that the latter
     technically allows them to @chown anything guildmaster- and
     lower-owned in the master and auxiliary rooms.  However, it allows
     the Building Head to @chown items between BCs- and to the
     BC-<location>-powered.

Enforcers - As Storyteller above, plus being @powered Security at

     Guildmaster level, in order to handle problem players.  Optionally
     always given to Storytellers.

Coders - @set Architect.  Head Coder - Always trust your head coder.

     @set Architect for the everyday bit.  Give access to a maintenance
     Councilor bit for special code projects.  Finished code along those
     lines should get @chowned to the bc-admin-councilor.  If you as the
     MU* Head(s) don’t know Softcode well, or want to leave anything
     Code to your Head Coder, also give them optional access to a
     maintenance Royalty bit in order to properly code
     banning/blacklisting +commands and other rare code that requires
     Royalty powers.  Again, chown finished code to bc-admin-royalty.

MU* Head(s) - You’re the boss(es). But please use an Architect bit for your

     everyday things.  Keep Immortal to yourself.  Keep #1 to yourself.
     And seriously avoid using either of them except for creating a
     Royalty bit or doing intricate DB maintenance.

Site Admins - They already have more powers than any in-game bit can ever

     have ;) Depending on actual involvement with your game, their
     abilities in-game can range from merely being @powered free_wall
     for notifying players of downtimes and/or being @powered shutdown
     in order to shut down the game for maintenance, up to being the
     only person with actual access to #1.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Globals,  Next: Quota,  Up: Bitlevels

1.6.3.8 Globals
...............

Handle necessary functionality for adminning through the admin-only
globals and softcode.

The setup I personally suggest is to have ALL staffers be AT MAX
Architect-level for everyday work and communication, with special coders
that -really- require it having Councilor-characters available to log
into for maintenance or special code setup.  Technically if everything
is done right, the Coder(s) of the game do not require higher privileges
than Architect for the vast majority of things.  Royalty-level code
should be a rare exception, if at all necessary.  The MU* Head(s) or
site-admin should be the only one having access to #1, Immortals or
perhaps even Royalty.  The BC’s, Global Function objects and Function
objects at level Royalty and higher have simply been provided as a
if-necessary convenience.

Current objects are only @chowned to certain bitlevels if it is really
required for them to function.  Whenever possible, they have been
@chowned to the mortal BC-Admin-Mortal.  All custom global functions
listed above are on the semi- -mortal Global Functions object.  The
Master Room and Auxiliary Room have been @chowned to BC-Admin-Architect.

The Comsystem and +bboard are owned by BC-Admin-Architect, which means
that higher bitlevels might not be able to use those systems if they
hide and set themselves DARK. This is intentional.  The Architect
bitlevel is enough to freely set attributes on players, so these systems
did not need anything higher, and it prioritizes Councilor+ as mere
mainenance-duty bitlevels.  Even the MU* Head should log on as an
Architect for everyday things.

The Comsystem and BBOARD have been modified to be configurable by
Architect and higher.  Both systems have a CANUSE attribute with the
according code on them.  Note that if you want both systems to be only
configurable by Councilor+, that instead of @chowning them to a
Councilor after changing those attribute for Councilor or higher, I
suggest to simply @set the bboard and comsystem core objects NO_MODIFY
instead, keeping them at Architect-power but making them unmodifyable by
Architects.

1.6.3.9 Quota
.............

I highly recommend the use of the alternative @quota system.
BC-Admin-Mortal and BC-Admin-Guildmaster both have this @quota system
set up on themselves.  Both of them have a high amount of money for
everyday operations.  You should not give them free quota or money.

1.6.3.10 Functions

I also recommend to setup most global functions with /Privileged even if
they are mortal-powered, to make them work even when players are set
NO_CODE and WANDERER by default.

Enjoy!

1.7 What FLAGS, TOGGLES, POWERS, DEPOWERS, and BITLEVELS mean in RhostMUSH

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Flags<3>,  Next: Toggles<2>,  Up: What FLAGS TOGGLES POWERS DEPOWERS and BITLEVELS mean in RhostMUSH

1.7.1 Flags
-----------

Flags are pretty much exactly the same as any other mush.  It’s a flag
that you set or unset on a target which then enables/disables or alters
something that target can do.  There’s help on all the flags in help and
wizhelp.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Toggles<2>,  Next: @power,  Prev: Flags<3>,  Up: What FLAGS TOGGLES POWERS DEPOWERS and BITLEVELS mean in RhostMUSH

1.7.2 Toggles
-------------

Toggles were designed as a single point flag that immediately enables or
disables a set ability or condition, thus a ‘toggle’.  It works exactly
like a flag and was originally designed for two reasons.  To distinguish
from the multi-meaning of a ‘flag’, and because frankly we ran out of
flag space :)


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: @power,  Next: @depower,  Prev: Toggles<2>,  Up: What FLAGS TOGGLES POWERS DEPOWERS and BITLEVELS mean in RhostMUSH

1.7.3 @power
------------

A power is similar to a power on other mushes, but unlike them, our
powers are multi-tier.  This means that they can be customized to
empower something at a given bitlevel.  You may empower something from
guildmaster up to councilor level.  There are some powers with a power
level of N/A meaning they are a toggle power granting an absolute power
level as specified in the help for that power.  This requires the
INHERIT flag for non-players to inherit powers, however, a specific
object can be granted a power as well.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: @depower,  Next: Multi-tiered bitlevel systems,  Prev: @power,  Up: What FLAGS TOGGLES POWERS DEPOWERS and BITLEVELS mean in RhostMUSH

1.7.4 @depower
--------------

This is the anti-thesis of @power.  Also, depowers do not require
inheritance.  They also have priority over flags, toggles, and powers.
You can use depower to remove or lower abilities and control from a
target, even a full wizard (royalty) can be depowered.

1.7.5 Multi-tiered bitlevel systems
-----------------------------------

RhostMUSH offers a multi-tier bitlevel system.  They go in order of
presidence You do not have to use all these bits, only use what you
want.

* Menu:

* ghod (#1) <bitlevel 7>: ghod #1 <bitlevel 7>.
* Immortal(i) <Level 6> - Basically #1: Immortal i <Level 6> - Basically #1.

1.7.5.1 ghod (#1) <bitlevel 7>
..............................

This bitlevel can do everything.  Only those who you trust with absolute
power should have this.  Period.

1.7.5.2 Immortal(i) <Level 6> - Basically #1
............................................

The only thing this bitlevel can not do is directly effect #1, set/unset
some internal flags/attributes, and set/unset the immortal flag.  These
players can do EVERYTHING else.  Treat this bit as you would treat #1.
Only give it to those you know without a doubt you can trust.

   * Can do everything except set some internal flags, effect #1, and
     set/remove the immortal flag.

1.7.5.3 Royalty(W) <Level 5> - FULL wizbit level
................................................

This is your standard wizard.  They can do everything you’re used to on
other mushes that wizards can do.  In addition, they also override all
locks by default (this can be disabled), and they have an enhanced
wizcloaking ability (which also can be disabled).  They can also set all
the lower bitlevels.

   * All things of Level 4 and lower

   * Ability to set more flags: STOP, NOSTOP, FUBAR

   * Ability to @attribute,

   * Ability to WIZCLOAK

1.7.5.4 Councilor(a) <Level 4> - High wizbit level
..................................................

This is your almost-but-not-quite wizard.  They have access to about 80%
of the wizard commands.  This includes @nuke, @toad, @newpassword and
the like.  The only things they can’t do that wizards can is cloak,
override locks, and use some of the database manipulation tools in
wizhelp.

   * All things of Level 3 and lower

   * Ability to set more flags: NOCONNECT, WANDERER, FREE

   * Ability to @nuke, @toad, @boot, @chownall, @dbck, @poor,

1.7.5.5 Architect(B) <Level 3> - Middle wizbit level
....................................................

This is your sub-wizard.  They still have the ability to control
anything their bitlevel and lower (including @chown, @destroy, etc) but
do not have any control of other players (like @nuke, @toad, etc) but
they can set the slave flag.  Otherwise, all things their level and
lower they can treat as if they owned it.

   * All things of Level 2

   * Ability to fully control and modify anything their level and lower
     (including @cloning, @destroying, etc)

   * Ability to use @tel on anything their level and lower.

   * Ability to bypass jump_ok rooms on anything their level & lower.

   * Ability to set some restricted flags: SLAVE, NO_YELL

   * Has infinite quota and money

   * Able to give negative money (Steal)

   * Able to @toggle the MONITOR

1.7.5.6 Guildmaster(g) <Level 2> - Lowest wizbit level
......................................................

This is the lowest wiz bit.  They only have moderate abilities.  They
can examine/decompile anything their level and lower, they can
@guild/@quota people, and they have a few other minor abilities.  They
don’t have free money however.

   * Ability to access things remotely (long_fingers)

   * Things are FREE for them in the queue.

   * Can see dbref#’s of things their level and lower

   * Can examine/decompile things their level and lower.

   * Can set @quota/@guild on their level and lower.

1.7.5.7 Wanderer <bitlevel 0>
.............................

This is a hinderance flag.  This flag is automatically set on new
players that are created (which can be disabled).  This flag stops the
player from creating/destroying any database information.  In effect it
stops them from any type of building type commands.  They still are
allowed to set/unset locks/attributes/etc though without hinderance.

1.7.5.8 Guest <bitlevel 0 as well>
..................................

This is a bigger hinderance flag.  By default all guests should be set
this.  This flag stops the player from ANY database manipulation along
with @teleporting, and many other advanced commands.  It’s extreamly
dehibilatating.

1.8.1 Considerations to locking down restrictions in RhostMUSH
--------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, you want to have things run at various privilage levels and
do not want to have things with too much access.  Weither that is online
objects or players you want to block from connecting to your mush.
Here’s things you can do.

One thing to keep in mind is that RhostMUSH, unlike PennMUSH is not flag
dependant on permission level, it’s ownership based.  While setting a
wizard flag on an object would work, it’s not recommended and it is
instead recommended to chown the object in question to a wizard (like
your wizard holder character) Then the object must be set inherit to
actually inherit the wizard.

Note: inherit is required to inherit anything from the player. Flags, powers,

     toggles.  The only thing that is inherited automatically is
     depowers.

We have various flag levels.  It is strongly recommanded you check
wizhelp on ‘control’ for a detailed overview of what each bitlevel can
or can not do prior to giving the ownership to the object.  Things
useful for tweaking control on players and objects:

     @icmd - Very useful. Please see wizhelp on it. It disallows commands

          from executing including overriding them with softcode
          alternatives

     @admin access - Changes permissions, disables, or sets to be overridden a

          command.  Useful when you plan to override commands with

1.8.2.6 Flags
.............

     GUEST - This is your guest flag, it should only be set on guests
     WANDERER - the WANDERER flag is default on new players.  This flag
     disables

          all building abilitites of the player.

     NO_COMMAND - You can use this to stop a player from being able to connect

          without worrying about changing their password

     FUBAR - As the flag states, it f*’s them up beind all recognition.

          It essentially stops them from doing absolutely anything in
          the mush but pose and say.  Yes, it even disables the quit
          command.

     SLAVE - Funny enough, slave allows anything but say and pose. To ruin

          a troll’s life, set both FUBAR and SLAVE and sit back and
          smile.

     NO_TEL - The target can’t teleport or be teleported NO_MOVE - The
     target is locked at their location unable to move at all NO_WALL -
     They do not see any @wall except a wizard @wall/no_prefix.  This

          has the bonus of snuffing db save messages.

     NO_POSSESS - Sometimes it’s useful to grant a builder character to multiple

          players.  The NO_POSSESS flag makes it so that player can not
          be logged in more than 2 times.

     NO_MODIFY - The target can not be modified (except by immortal/#1)
     NO_EXAMINE - The target can not be examined/decompiled (except by
     immortal/#1) STOP - Once a matching $command is found on an object
     set STOP, it

          ‘stops’ trying to find other $command matches.

     NOSTOP - If a target that is set STOP is also set NOSTOP, it will check

          the master room for a command and execute that as well if
          found.

     NO_PESTER - Stops target from @pemit or whisper.  You may use @icmd
     as well.  NO_OVERRIDE - Useful for immortals.  By default they
     override all locks,

          including attribute locks.  This makes it so an immortal’s
          passing of locks will behave like a mortals

     NO_USELOCK - This is like NO_OVERRIDE but only effects uselocks. You likely

          want to set this on your immortal and wizard.

     NO_ANSINAME - stops a target from having an ansified name NO_CODE -
     lock down advanced coding from a target SPAMMONITOR - stop a target
     from issuing more than 60 commands a minute.  FREE - Stop costing
     money for day to day processing of commands/building

     Allows a @program to resume if someone reconnects IGNOREZONE -
     Enables a zone to process @icmd’s PAGELOCK - Enforces target to

     Now let’s assume you have some troll attempting to use proxies to
     connect.  There’s multiple ways to stop this.

1.8.3.1 Blacklisting through external tor_pull.sh script
........................................................

     In ~/Rhost/Server/game you will see a script called tor_pull.sh
     Execute this by running (from the game directory) ./tor_pull.sh
     This populates the blacklist with registered proxies from various
     sites on the internet.  If you want specified ip’s added, feel free
     to add them at the end of this file.

1.8.3.2 Blacklisting through internal @blacklist command
........................................................

     On the mush, have as part of your startup @blacklist/load This will
     load in the generated blacklist file for automatic forbid sites
     based on the ip.

1.8.3.3 Blacklisting through internal @tor command
..................................................

     @tor.  Please see ‘wizhelp tor’ on how to set this up.  It in
     effect will actively block all known exit nodes for TOR’s
     annonymous proxy service.  It self-updates and will actively block
     TOR connections.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Blacklisting through internal @admin command,  Prev: Blacklisting through internal @tor command,  Up: Methods to block anonymous connections and the pros and cons of doing so

1.8.3.4 Blacklisting through internal @admin command
....................................................

     @admin proxy_checker (please see wizhelp) This little doodad uses
     MTU checking against packet size which will detect most methods of
     proxies.  Sadly, this also has false positives because some
     situations require a differentating MTU value such as briged
     network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or similar
     encapsulated network services.  However, this option has several
     settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies to
     downright forbidding them.  If you’re being actively attacked, it
     may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection.

1.8.4.1 Quickstart for SSL setup with stunnel
.............................................

  1. Modify your netrhost.conf file and add/change the following
     parameters: A. stunnel_reip 1 B. stunnel_cmd SECRET-MAGIC-COOKIE

            1. SECRET-MAGIC-COOKIE is a case sensitive single word
               phrase.  Any printable character other than the ‘#’
               character is allowable.  You may use up to 30 characters.

            2. Make sure the secret is a hard to guess phrase.  This is
               used by stunnel to forward on the originating IP address.

       3. stunnel_host localhost 127.0.0.1 othersite.goes.here 1.  This
          is optional.  2.  If you do not specify it it defaults to
          ‘localhost 127.0.0.1’.

               If your domain has a unique name like
               ‘localhost.localdomain’ like some ubuntu distributions,
               then you should customize your stunnel_host.

  2. go into the stunnel directory

  3. ./stunnel_setup.sh A. Choose the defaults or alter them based on
     preferences B. Make sure to choose the warpbubble conf file

  4. ./stunnel_start.sh

  5. Use ./stunnel_stop.sh to stop the SSL tunnel at any time

You do not need to shutdown the ssl handler if you shutdown the mush.
They are entirely separate processes.

1.8.4.2 Detailed SSL setup with stunnel
.......................................

To setup SSL connectivity, we use the STUNNEL application to tunnel SSL
to the mush.  This acts a bit like a man in the middle but remains
controlled by the game owner which would have access to the end point
anyway.

Note: it is assumed you will have already initially set up your
netrhost.conf.

1.8.4.3 stunnel directory
.........................

You would set up the stunnel from the ‘stunnel’ directory.  There the
following files are of relevance:

README – a readme explaining the points of stunnel stunnel.conf.example
– The example stunnel.conf file.  If you wish to

     create this manually you’re welcome to.  Just make sure the end
     file is stunnel.conf

stunnel_setup.sh – the script to build a stunnel.conf file for you

     which will be dropped at your specified location.

stunnel_kill.sh – Stop/terminate the stunnel process.  stunnel_start.sh
– Start the stunnel process.  warpbubble.pl – the perl script that
handles stunnel to mush

     connectivity.

stunnel_src – If you do not have stunnel, this directory will

     allow you to download, compile and locally install.

1.8.4.4 Modifying netrhost.conf
...............................

To be able to utilize SSL, you first must set your netrhost.conf file
with the relevant information to enable SSL connectiions.  These three
config options must be set to be able to use SSL, however, sconnect_host
if not set will default to ‘localhost 127.0.0.1’.

sconnect_reip 1 – This enables the SSL tunnel layer handler within

     rhost.

sconnect_cmd XYZZY – this will set the secret SSL command handshake

     command to XYZZY. This is case sensitive and can be up to 31
     characters.  Please make sure to only use printable non-whitespace
     characters.  Ergo: one word

sconnect_host wildcards – This allows wildcarded sites (one or more) to allow

     to access the sconnect/stunnel handler.  This defaults to
     ‘localhost’ and ‘127.0.0.1’ so if you have ‘localhost.localdomain’
     instead then you must set this to whatever is seen as ‘localhost’
     to you.  You can verify this by checking your /etc/hosts file.

Note: the sconnect_host is optional. If you do not specify it, it will

     default to two values: ‘localhost’ and ‘127.0.0.1’.

1.8.4.5 Running the stunnel setup program
.........................................

At this point you’re ready to run the stunnel setup program.  So at this
point type the following:

     ./stunnel_setup.sh

This will prompt you through settings.  Most you can select the defaults
to.  The SSL port you may need to change based on your administrative
requirements.  It will prompt you with whatever you set for your mush
name.  If you have not selected a mush name at this point, you can
select the defaults.

You will want to use the config file for warpbubble as this hides the
secret.

Be aware that if you have DNS host lookups disabled on your mush, you
MUST have 127.0.0.1 as an entry for your sconnect_host file.

must not be the port the mush is running on and requires a separate
port.

1.9.1 Signals and why you need them for control
-----------------------------------------------

Rhost by default allows signals at the shell to handle various processes
in-game.

The following signals are useful.

* Menu:

* TERM (kill -TERM or kill -15): TERM kill -TERM or kill -15.
* USR1 (kill -USR1): USR1 kill -USR1.
* USR2 (kill -USR2): USR2 kill -USR2.
* KILL (kill -KILL or kill -9): KILL kill -KILL or kill -9.

1.9.1.1 TERM (kill -TERM or kill -15)
.....................................

        - This will immediately terminate the mush, dumping a special
          flatfile called netrhost.db.TERM and scramming the db in
          question by force-closing it without any writes.  A TERM is
          the effort for the mush to shut down the mush as fast as
          possible to avoid any db corruption if possible since a TERM
          signal is common during a server shutdown, so time is
          paramount.

1.9.1.2 USR1 (kill -USR1)
.........................

        - This by default issues a reboot on the server.  This is a
          special parameter because this can actually be changed in-game
          to do any number of other things.  Please refer to the
          RhostMUSH running in question if this is the default behavior
          or if the method for USR1 is doing something else.

1.9.1.3 USR2 (kill -USR2)
.........................

        - This will shutdown (cleanly) the mush.  This behaves as if you
          issued a @shutdown from within the game, and follows all
          proper procedure in bringing the game down cleanly and safely.
          This shoudl be used when doing maintenance on the game or if
          you need to bring it down from the shell.

1.9.1.4 KILL (kill -KILL or kill -9)
....................................

        - This signal can not be caught and will immediately terminate
          the game without any safty to the database at all.  Short of
          something horribly wrong going on, this should never be used
          to bring down your mush.  Doing so will almost certainly
          corrupt your databases (ALL OF THEM) that are open, including
          but not limited to your main database, your mail database,
          your autoregistration database, and so forth.  So if you do
          this, plan to do some database recovery from your flat files.
          Also, when you bring down a mush in this manner, you need to
          issue Startmush -f to bring it back up.

1.9.2.2 WARNING: Never kill -9 Rhost
....................................

Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you kill -9 your mush unless you don’t
care for the database.  The reason is if the mush happens to be saving,
in any method, to the database, especially a QDBM database, you will
likely have just corrupted your database, so pull out a flatfile to
recover.

Sadly, this also may occur if the server hosting you takes a nose-dive
in the middle of a db write.  Rhost can recover corruption in-game while
up, but if it bombs in the middle of a write, all bets are off.  :)

1.9.3 Autoshutdown script
-------------------------

tweek ‘autolog.h’ with the proper parameters.

Both of these are intended to be used for automations (automated
processes) like your rc.local file and/or startup scripts when you bring
your server up.

1.9.4 Network Port redirector
-----------------------------

This is a port redirector incase you decide to move your mush to a new
site/port.  To use, first, compile the code.  To do this you would type
the following:

     cc portmsg.c -o portmsg

if ‘cc’ is not defined, try the following:

     gcc portmsg.c -o portmsg

Once compiled, you would then modify the file ‘file’ to describe the
mush, what was done, where it’s moved to, then specify the IP address
and the PORT where specified.

To launch the application, you would then type:

     ./portmsg file <port>

Where <port> is the port where the mush used to run at.

The rhost.cron file will be in the syntax as follows:

username (or dbref#) command1;command2;command3;…;commandN command
command command1;command2;command3;…;commandN

You can have commands strung together with a semicolon on the same line.
This counts as a single line of input.  You can have at most 20 lines of
commands after the target you wish to execute the commands as.  The
target may be a player name OR a dbref# of any valid dbref# within the
game.  Invalid targets will abort the cron process.  Non-printable
characters in the cron file will abort the process.  Any aborts or
warnings will be logged in the netrhost.gamelog.

Here is a working example of the code cron file.  This example will
perform dumps of the mush.

1.9.7.1 Textfile Frequently Asked Questions
...........................................

Q: How do I put color in these files?  A1: Look at ansi.h and you need
to put the literal ASCII codes.

     They will look like: ^[[0m (for ANSI_NORMAL). That’s <ESC>[

A2: You can enable ansi_txtfiles then use %c (or %x/%m) encoding

     for ansi, however you compiled your Rhost.

Q: I want to design my own txt files to read in the mush.  A: Easy.
Design them like help.txt would be set up, mkindx the file,

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Stack limit and debugging,  Next: How to reset the password for #1,  Up: Troubleshooting

1.10.1 Stack limit and debugging
--------------------------------

Rhost uses a stack limit in the debug monitor.

This stack limit is set to a reasonable amount of 1000.  This is defined
in the debug.h file in the hdrs directory.

This will directly impact the function_recursion_limit from being set
above 100.  If, for whatever reason, you really must have a ridiculously
high recursion limit, then it is a suggestion to manually modify the
stack limit in debug.h to a higher number.

We have reasonably set it to 10000 without too much issue, but keep in
mind, the overhead is higher for every stack you throw on the process
table.  Higher stack means more memory used.

Also be aware that your shell stack limit directly is affected to this
value.

Type: ulimit -a

This will show you your shell stack limits.  Do NOT set the STACKMAX
value higher than your shell’s stack value.

The value in ~/Rhost/Server/hdrs/debug.h is currently set as:

#define STACKMAX 1000

Feel free to change this to a higher value if you wish.

The caveat.  This effects the debug stack daemon.  Meaning, the only way
for this to be updated is through @shutdown and then a fresh
./Startmush.

A @reboot WILL NOT LOAD IN A NEW DEBUG MONITOR!!!!

You can issue @list stack to see the current stack ceiling ingame.

1.10.3.1 Changes to conf for high-bit CPUs
..........................................

RhostMUSH automatically detects 64-bit platforms, and should compile
cleanly on these.

In case you are trying to compile Rhost on some other crazy-wide CPUs
such as the PS2, PS3 or other 128 or 256 bit CPUs, you can easily do so
by changing a few lines of code in conf.c.

change: typedef unsigned int pmath1; typedef int pmath2; #define ALLIGN1
4

to: typedef unsigned long pmath1; typedef long pmath2; #define ALLIGN1 8

, replacing 8 with the size of your CPU’s long integer.  (4 for 32-bit,
8 for 64-bit, 16 for 128-bit, etc etc)

RhostMUSH has only been tested to work on the AMD64, but there is no
reason to believe the same will not hold true for IA64.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Changes to autconf for certain systems,  Prev: Changes to conf for high-bit CPUs,  Up: Troubleshooting difficulties compiling RhostMUSH

1.10.3.2 Changes to autconf for certain systems
...............................................

You should not have to worry about this, but incase something really
weird occurs, you may need to look into these changes…

The autoconfig.h file needs to have modifications to it by hand.

There are three manual entries:

This one sets how it defines the int to character pointer.  It’s safe to
keep it as ‘unsigned int’ for 32 bit platforms.  For non 32-bit, define
it to how an int is defined on that system.

     typedef unsigned int pmath1;

This one sets how it defines the signed int to character pointer.  Same
restrictions apply as above for unsigned int.

     typedef int pmath2;

This sets the allignment for the given platform.  4 represents a 32 bit
platform.  8 would represent a 64 bit platform, etc.  Change
accordingly.

     #define ALLIGN1 4

Make sure these three entries are defined in your autoconf.h file else
the mush will not compile.

1.10.4 Dealing with DB Corruption
---------------------------------

Ok.  Your database won’t come up.

If you are reading this, then likely the scenerio is one of the
following:

  1. The mush says it can’t find your database files.

  2. The mush says it can’t read or load your database files.

  3. The mush seems to load fine but I can’t log in anyone and when I do
     all the names and attributes of things seem to be gone!

  4. Bringing up your mail database

First thing is first.  Don’t have a panic attack.

......................................

If you never touched the >>*<<database or muddb_name params, you should
be good.

Verify your >>*<<database params (and muddb_name) are still set to
‘netrhost’ as part of the name.  Ergo, the default values and you didn’t
change them.  These should match up with the filenames in your data
directory.

If these names do not match up, it can’t find the database files to
load.  So you shouldn’t have to change these names, ever.  :)

If you never modified this file, you should be good.

The gamename should be ‘netrhost’ for this file.  This does NOT control
the name of your game.  This controls the name of all the files as
associated to the mush.  So changing this means the netrhost.conf file,
all your database files, and so forth.  Please don’t change this :)

1.10.4.6 Verify you have enough disk space. (quota)
...................................................

Some account have a limited quota to run in.  If you reached or exceed
your disk quota, you can have a corrupted database.  So always keep your
eye on the size.  quota -s to see a human readable format to see how
much quota you have left.  You want to make sure current in use is below
the ‘grace’ and soft/hard limits shown.  If not, you’re out of space.

You will need to remove some files before you repair and bring up your
mush again.  Try to keep your quota at least 200 megs free to allow
plenty of wonderful growth space for the mush.

1.10.4.7 Verify you have enough disk space. (system)
....................................................

The second way you can run out of disk space is by the filesystem
itself.  do a df -h .  in your ‘game’ directory’.  That is df -h
<period>.  This will return how much disk space is being used and how
much remains.  If it shows 100% used, you’re out of disk space and the
db is corrupt.

At this point, you’re pretty screwed.  You can see if anything exists in
your system to free up some space, but if the filesystem itself is
filled, reach out to the owner of the server and let them know.  It’s a
much bigger deal than just your mush if that’s the case.

Until this issue is resolved, you can not repair and bring up your mush.
No disk to run the game.

.......................................................................................................................................

Ok, at this point you likely had your mush up when the physical server
went down hard.  Weither through an emergency shutdown or a physical
power outage, your db likely was brought down hard during a write, so it
left it in a corrupt state.  These things happen.  This is why we always
strongly request you make daily flatfile dumps.

.....................

If you have no flatfile backup or never bothered with backups?  I’m
sorry, at this point you’re SOA. There’s no easy way to recover a

be able to help you to piece meal things out of it, but otherwise it’s a

1.10.4.10 The good news
.......................

If you made backups, or if the server had a normal shutdown, you likely
have a flatfile backup.  You will see a netrhost.db.flat in either the
‘data’ directory or ‘prevflat’ directory.  That is your manual flatfile
backup.

If the server had a normal shutdown, you will see a file called
netrhost.db.TERMFLAT. This is a scram-emergency db flatfile.  It
attempts to write this at the time of server shutdown to hopefully keep
a clean backup in the case of issues since it identifies the server is
coming down hard.  Make sure if you plan to use the TERMFLAT as your
recovery flatfile that the very last line shows something like ** END OF
DUMP >>**<<.  That shows you had a successful backup.

-------------------------------------------

It says when you try to access mail that mail is disabled and/or off.

Nothing you do can bring it on line.  Well, this is bad, but not
horrible.

The mail db is totally separate from the main game database.  This means
that it in no way damaged or corrupted your main mush database.

The bad news?  Yes.  Your mail database is corrupt.  To bring it back,
is it hopes that you read ahead of time about how to backup your mush,
which would include the mail database.

1.10.5.1 Backing up your mail database
......................................

wmail/unload – this flatfile dumps your mail db.  You should run it
daily.

To recover your mail, it assumes you have a mail flatfile in either the
~/Server/game/data directory or the ~/Server/game/prevflat directory.
The latter directory is used in junction to the backup_flat.sh and will
always house the latest flatfile if not one recently dumped in your data
directory.

1.10.5.2 Automatically recovering your mail database
....................................................

wmail/load

Yup, that’s it.  It’ll take care of everything else.  Isn’t automation
grand?

Doesn’t even require a reboot :)

NOTE: You may at this point wish to run the following:

     wmail/fix – this fixes the mail database and sync’s it to the mush
     db.  wmail/lfix – this loads in the fixed mail database

If you have a very old mail database, this is likely going to be
required to sync against nuked players and other changes to the game
since the flatfile.

If this is a new db that you have, you can skip the fixing.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Manually recovering your mail database,  Prev: Automatically recovering your mail database,  Up: Dealing with a corrupt mail database

1.10.5.3 Manually recovering your mail database
...............................................

To recover your mail manually, you need to delete your mail databases,
reboot, then reload your mail flatfiles.  If you have no mail flatfiles,
well, you’re going to have to start over with the mail database.  Sorry.

First, go into the ‘game’ subdirectory.  Inside that directory is a
‘data’ directory.

You will be deleting all the files with the following names:

RhostMUSH.mail.* (like RhostMUSH.mail.dir/RhostMUSH.mail.pag)
RhostMUSH.folder.* (like RhostMUSH.folder.dir/RhostMUSH.folder.pag)

DO NOT DELETE OTHER NAMED FILES!!!

Once these files are deleted, you may issue a @reboot to restart the
mush.  This will unlock the mail system and load in a fresh db.

Now, if you have flatfiles of the old mail database, you will see in
either the ‘data’ directory or the ‘prevflat’ directory files that are
called:

RhostMUSH.dump.folder RhostMUSH.dump.mail

Make sure these two files are in the ‘data’ subdirectory.  Copy them in
if they exist in your ‘prevflat’ directory.

Once they are in the ‘data’ directory, within the mush type: wmail/load

This loads in the flatfile and recover the mail database.

Now, at this point the mail db may not be 100% in-sync with the game db.

So let’s fix it.

wmail/fix – this will run a fix on the mail db and repair any issues.

wmail/lfix – this will load the fixed flatfile back into the mush.

At this point you should be good to go.

I would NEVER change from QDBM back to GDBM, but if you’re set on it
these steps:

You would use the same steps if you plan to move QDBM to GDBM. I however
would not do this.  Moving from QDBM to GDBM is a huge step backwards.
Seriously, don’t do it unless you have absolutely no other recourse.

However, WARNING: IF you plan (for whatever reason) to move from QDBM to
GDBM, you should verify the following: 1.  You have on a 64 bit system,
no object that has more than 400 attributes on it.  2.  You have on a 32
bit system, no object that has more than 750 attributes on it.  3.  Any
CONTENT of any attribute must be below 4000 characters in length.  4.
Once you have that done, you may follow the procedures below on

Makefile and the automated mysql stuff and all the other goodies that
isn’t really (easilly) done with just patch.sh.

Well, you’re in luck.  It is actually fairly easy to do.

This is what you have to do.

First thing’s first.

  1. Log into your existing mush.  Let’s make current backups of all
     your flatfiles.  Issue: A. @dump/flat B. wmail/unload C.
     @areg/unload D. newsdb/unload

  2. Shutdown your game (@shutdown)

  3. Make an image of all your current backed up files.  From The
     Server/game directory you would type:

          ./backup_flat.sh -s

     Please remember the ‘-s’ to the ./backup_flat.sh.

  4. Make note of the most recently created file in the directory
     Server/game/oldflat.  It’s usually named something like:

          RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz

     You will need this file later.

  5. Rename your ‘Rhost’ directory to something else.  This is the
     directory that you have containing the ‘Server’ directory.  Name it
     anything you want other than ‘Rhost’.  For those not used to unix
     you would type:

          mv Rhost Rhost_old

  6. 
     Pull in the latest Rhost. You would type:

          git clone ‘https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk’ Rhost

     You would type this in the same directory you have renamed your old
     ‘Rhost’ directory

  7. 
     go into the Rhost/Server directory. Type:

          make confsource

     Select what options you want (including the mysql and other
     goodies) then compile it (also within the menu, it’s the ‘r’
     option).

8 Once your game is compiled and ready to go you need to copy in

     the data from your old game.  Copy the RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz we
     mentioned in step #4 to the Server/game directory of your NEW GAME
     DIRECTORY. From within the ‘game’ directory of your current game
     you should be able to issue (if you named the old one Rhost_old):
     Again this needs to be done FROM YOUR Server/game directory!!!  A.
     cp netrhost.conf netrhost.conf.orig B. cp
     ../../Rhost_old/Server/game/RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz .  C. tar
     -zxvf RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz D. Compare your current
     netrhost.conf to the default one that came with

          the source (that you renamed to netrhost.conf.orig).  Likely
          the only sections you have to add to your current
          netrhost.conf (that came with your RhostMUSH.dbflat1.tar.gz
          archive), will be toward the end, with the include
          rhost_ingame.conf and rhost_mysql.conf.  Depending on how old
          your game is coming from you may need to add more options.
          Any config option that is the same between the netrhost.conf
          files do not have to be copied over, and you want to keep your
          custom settings (like don’t port or other stuff you have
          already customized).

       5. ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm data/netrhost.db.flat
          data/netrhost.db.new This loads in your flatfile information.

       6. ./Startmush Your ./Startmush should re-index all your txt
          files you originally made.

       7. In your game type the following as an immortal or as #1.

            1. wmail/load This will load in your mail flatfile.

            2. @areg/load This will load in your autoregistration
               flatfile (if available)

            3. newsdb/load This will load in your hardcoded bbs flatfile
               (if available)

  9. You should be good to go on a current directory structure for
     Rhost.  Enjoy!

1.11.3 Adding MySQL to RhostMUSH older than 3.9.5p2
---------------------------------------------------

MySQL is now native in RhostMUSH as of 3.9.5p2.

To autodetect it, YOU MUST HAVE mysql_config installed and running on
your server.  Without this, even if you have mysql db installed it won’t
be able to recognize the parameters you will need for it and will thus
fail.  Please check your linux distribution to see what packages are
needed to install mysql_config.
`***************************************************************************'
** IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT ** IMPORTANT `IMPORTANT **

*****************************************************************************'

Download the git repository to a seperate directory so that you can copy
over the files that it requires you to.

Suggestion: git clone ‘http://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk’ ~/tmprho

If you are patching UP from an older version, you need to update the
following files:

  1. update your src/Makefile to the one in the 3.9.5p2+ repo ( cp
     ~/tmprho/Server/src/Makefile ~/Rhost/Server/src/Makefile )

  2. update your bin/asksource.* files to the one in the 3.9.5p2+ repo (
     cp ~/tmprho/Server/bin/asksource.* ~/Rhost/Server/bin/ )

  3. append ‘include rhost_mysql.conf’ BEFORE the rhost_ingame.conf file
     and before the section that says ‘define local aliases’ toward the
     end of your netrhost.conf file.  ( edit your
     ~/Rhost/Server/game/netrhost.conf file )

  4. copy the game/rhost_mysql.conf file from the 3.9.5p2+ repo ( cp
     ~/tmprho/Server/game/rhost_mysql.conf ~/Rhost/Server/game/ )

  5. The following lines have to be REPLACED/CHANGED in local.c ( toward
     the top ): ( you may edit this or copy the one from the other
     distro ) ( do either: edit ~/Rhost/Server/src/local.c ) ( or: cp

1.12.1.1 Modifying sourcode to add a module
...........................................

This requires hooking your changes into local.c, then modifying the
Makefile (in the src directory) for any new source files that you wish
to add.

Something to be aware of is that all localized data is ran after the
system cache subroutine.

1.12.1.2 Adding an @startup to make use of modules
..................................................

This means that if your code is depending on @startups, you need to put
a delay in the @startup so that your local code can be loaded in as
modules prior to the @startup execution.

Something that will not work:

@startup <me=@superhappyfuncommand> loadmeup=now

A small alteration that will likely make this work fine.

@startup <me=@wait> <1=@superhappyfuncommand> loadmeup=now

That 1 second delay for the queue will give the game engine time to load
in your module code.

1.12.1.3 Contributing your module back to Rhost
...............................................

If you wish your modules to be part of the main Rhost distribution you
have two options:

  1. Attempt to hack the bin/asksource.sh and bin/asksource.blank files.

  2. Ask one of the Rhost devs to do it for you :)

1.12.2.2 WARNING: Never kill -9 Rhost
.....................................

Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you kill -9 your mush unless you don’t
care for the database.  The reason is if the mush happens to be saving,
in any method, to the database, especially a QDBM database, you will
likely have just corrupted your database, so pull out a flatfile to
recover.

Sadly, this also may occur if the server hosting you takes a nose-dive
in the middle of a db write.  Rhost can recover corruption in-game while
up, but if it bombs in the middle of a write, all bets are off.  :)

1.12.3 Reality levels
---------------------

Reality levels are a means to forbid (or allow) interaction between
objects in the same location.

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Visibility,  Next: Descriptions,  Up: Reality levels

1.12.3.1 Visibility
...................

Each object (player, room, exit, thing) has two lists of reality levels.
An Rx list, which describe what it can see and a Tx list, which describe
where it can be seen.  Those are bitfields.  In order for X to see Y a
bitwise ‘and’ is performed between X’s RxLevel and Y’s TxLevel.  If the
result is not 0, then X sees Y. If the result is 0, as far as X is
concerned, Y doesn’t exist.  This affects contents lists, exit lists,
look, say, pose, @emit, @verb, connect/disconnect, has arrived/has left
messages, exit and object matching.  ‘here’ and ‘me’ match always.  It
doesn’t affect @remit, @pemit, page, WHO or channels.  By default, all
new objects are created with an RxLevel of 1 and TxLevel of 1.  Rooms
are an exception, created with an RxLevel of 1 and a TxLevel of
0xFFFFFFFF. Those default levels can be changed with configuration
parameters.  An object is always visible to itself, even if its Rx and
Tx levels don’t match.  (See examples below)


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Descriptions,  Next: Configuration parameters,  Prev: Visibility,  Up: Reality levels

1.12.3.2 Descriptions
.....................

For every reality level defined, you can define an attribute that serves
as description.  If you look at something and match more than one of its
TxLevels, you’ll see all the corresponding descriptions on the target
object.  If the object doesn’t have any descriptions for the matching
levels, you’ll see the regular @desc.  The @adesc attribute on the
target is only triggered if the target can see the looker in turn.  It’s
only triggered once, no matter how many descs the looker sees.  The
@odesc is shown only to those people that see /both/ the looker and the
target.  Through extension, @afail/@ofail and similar pairs
(@adrop/@odrop, @asucc/@osucc etc) work in the same way.  @verb commands
are similary affected.  Softcoded commands are only matched on the
objects that can see the player.  The player doesn’t have to see the
object.  This includes commands in the Master Room.  Exits are treated
specially.  In order to be able to use an exit name (or to use the ‘move
<exit>’ command) the exit must be visible to the enactor.  In order to
pass through the exit, the exit must see the enactor in turn.  There are
reasons for this, which will become evident in the examples below.


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Configuration parameters,  Next: Example mush conf,  Prev: Descriptions,  Up: Reality levels

1.12.3.3 Configuration parameters
.................................

A few configuration parameters have been introduced to deal with the
reality levels.

     reality_level <name> <value> [<desc attribute name>]

This directive can only be used in the config file (not with the @admin
command) and should be repeated for each reality level you want to
define.  It defines a new level named <name> with a bitvalue of <value>
and an optional desc attribute.  There is a limit of 8 characters on
<name>, a 32-bit value on <value> (basically an unsigned long) and 32
characters on the attribute name.  A maximum of 32 reality levels can be
defined.

     def_exit_tx <value> def_exit_rx <value> def_room_tx <value>
     def_room_rx <value> def_player_rx <value> def_player_tx <value>
     def_thing_rx <value> def_thing_tx <value>

These 8 directives define the default reality levels of newly created
objects.  They can be set in the config file or with the @admin command.
Like above, <value> must be a decimal number.

     wiz_always_real <0|1>

If this parameter is set to 1 then wizards (and immortals on Rhost) will
see everything and will be visible to everyone.  Their effective Rx and
Tx levels will always be 0xFFFFFFFF. Also settable in the config file
and with the @admin command.

Compile with -DREALITY_LEVELS compile time option to enable ‘Real’ needs
to be ‘1’ This is an example file only to be added to the mush.conf file
Format: reality_level <8 char name> <hex-byte-mask> <optional-desc: DESC

File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Commands,  Next: Functions<3>,  Prev: Example mush conf,  Up: Reality levels

1.12.3.5 Commands
.................

Two wiz-only commands are used to set the reality levels of an object.

     @rxlevel <object>=<list> @txlevel <object>=<list>

<list> is a space-separated list of level names that have to be set on
the object.  If a level name is prefixed with an exclamation mark (!)
that level will be cleared from the object.  WARNING: Changing the Tx
levels of an object might make it invisible to you.  In this case, you
can still manipulate it by using his #dbref (or >>*<<player for
players).


File: rhostmushhandbook.info,  Node: Functions<3>,  Next: Example 1 A simplified Witchcraft setup,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Reality levels

1.12.3.6 Functions
..................

There are five functions that deal with reality levels.

     hasrxlevel(<object>,<level>) hastxlevel(<object>,<level>)

These two functions check if an object has the specified Rx or Tx level.
You must control <object>.  They return 0 or 1 and #-1 in case the
object does not exist or you don’t have permissions.

     rxlevel(<object>) txlevel(<object>)

These two functions return a space-separated list of the object’s Rx or
Tx levels.  Again, you must control the object.

     cansee(<obj1>,<obj2>)

A wiz-only function, returns 1 of <obj1> can see <obj2> from a reality
levels point of view.  It doesn’t check if the objects are in the same
location, the DARK/CLOAKED flags and so on.  Just <obj1>’s Rx level
against <obj2>’s Tx level.  WARNING: If you are using it on MUX2.0 with
/both/ reality levels and Wod Realms enabled, the function will perform
both checks and the Wod Realms version checks against the DARK flag.

1.12.3.7 Example 1: A simplified Witchcraft setup
.................................................

In Witchcraft, besides the various Gifted classes, characters can be
spirits There are spirit realms to which the mundane can not travel.
Therefore we will use 2 reality levels: Real and Ghost.  Since some
spirits can become solid for a limited period of time, we will also use
an additional desc for the Ghost level, called GHOSTDESC. Therefore in
the config file we will have:

     reality_level Real 1 reality_level Ghost 2 GHOSTDESC

Ghosts can pass through most mundane locks, so the exists should allows
the ghosts to pass:

     def_exit_rx 3

Note that def_exit_tx isn’t set.  Why?  Because ghosts see the mundane
world anyway, so a spirit character will have:

     @txlevel <player>=!Real Ghost @rxlevel <player>=Real Ghost

Let’s assume 3 players: John is a Mundane.  He won’t see spirits.
John’s Rx: Real John’s Tx: Real John’s @desc: This is John.  John’s
&GHOSTDESC: (Not important, since it’s never visible) Johh’s @adesc: %N
has looked at you.  John’s @odesc: has looked at John.

Jack is a Gifted.  He will sense spirits, but is still made from flesh
and blood so visible to mundanes.  Jack’s Rx: Real Ghost Jack’s Tx: Real
Jack’s @desc: This is Jack.  Jack’s &GHOSTDESC: (Not important, since
it’s never visible) Jack’s @adesc: %N has looked at you.  Jack’s @odesc:
has looked at Jack.

Frank is a ghost.  He will see other spirits as well as mundanes, but
won’t be visible to mundanes.  He can also become visible to everybody.
Frank’s Rx: Real Ghost Frank’s Tx: Ghost Frank’s @desc: This is Frank,
looking human.  Frank’s &GHOSTDESC: This is Frank’s ghostly shape.
Frank’s @adesc: %N has looked at you.  Frank’s @odesc: has looked at
Frank.

Following are commands that each of the players enter and what they see.
I’ll assume the +materialize command is defined like: &CMD_MATERIALIZE
<cmdobject>=$+materialize:@txlevel %#=Real; @pemit %#=You are now
material.

     John | Jack | Frank

1.12.3.8 Example 2: A WoD setup
...............................

The reality levels will be defined like this: reality_level Real 1
reality_level Obf1 2 reality_level Obf2 4 reality_level Obf3 8 OBFDESC
reality_level Obf4 16 OBFDESC reality_level Obf5 32 OBFDESC
reality_level Umbra 64 UMBRADESC reality_level Fae 128 FAEDESC
reality_level Shadow 256 SHADOWDESC reality_level All 511

5 levels of Obfuscation, Umbra, Dreaming, Wraiths.  ‘All’ is a handy
replacement for all levels, useful for wizards and wizobjects that
should be visible on all levels.  Also useful when you want to set an
object’s levels to something without knowing what he had before.
@rxlevel #276=!All Real !All will clear all levels, then the object will
gain the Real level.  There is more than one Obfuscation level because
of the relation between Auspex and Obfuscation.  A vampire with
Obfuscate 2, should not be visible by one with Auspex 1.  However one
with Auspex 3 should see another vampire with Obfuscate 1, 2 /or/ 3.
Obfuscated players can move if they have Obf > 1.  Umbral and Shadow
players should also be able to see most of the exits.  So the exits at
creation should have default levels of Real + Obf2 + Obf3 + Obf4 + Obf5
+ Umbra + Shadow = 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 256 = 381

     def_exit_rx 381 def_exit_tx 381

Obf1 is not included since an Obfuscated vampire should not be able to
move if it only has Obf1.  Therefore they won’t see the exits.  If you
want them to be able to see the exits, but not to use them, change the
default Tx of the exits:

     def_exit_rx 381 def_exit_tx 383

Joe the Mortal will have an RxLevel: Real and a TxLevel: Real Jack the
Malk, who likes to walk around Obfuscated and has Obfuscate 2 will have
an RxLevel: Real (he sees what the mortals see) but a TxLevel: Obf2
Jimmy the Nossie, who is using the Mask and has Obfuscate 4, but doesn’t
try to make himself invisible will have an RxLevel: Real (as Jack) and a
TxLevel: Real Obf4.  He will also set his @desc to what the mortals see
and &OBFDESC to his real slimy desc.  Simply put, he will be visible to
mortals, but not with his real desc.  Aldrin the Gangrel, has Auspex 4
and activates it.  Therefore, his TxLevel will still be Real, but
RxLevel: Real Obf1 Obf2 Obf3 Obf4 (all of them).  So he can see Joe,
Jack and Jimmy’s both descs.  Joe, on the other hand, won’t see Jack at
all.  He will still see Jimmy, but only Jimmy’s @desc, not the OBFDESC

Frida the Fae… will have RxLevel: Real Fae and TxLevel: Real Fae.  @desc
set to the mundane desc, &FAEDESC set to the Chimerical desc.  Emily the
Enchanted will have an RxLevel: Real Fae, but the TxLevel: Real.  No
&FAEDESC on her, although she’ll be able to see it the one on Frida.
Gil the Garou, while travelling through the Umbra, will have RxLevel:
Umbra and TxLevel: Umbra.  &UMBRADESC is his friend.  He won’t see
mortals or other characters who are not in the Umbra.  Barbie the
Bastet, who’s only peeking in the Umbra, without going there, will have
RxLevel: Umbra, TxLevel: Real.  Dangerous position since she can’t see
the things that see her.  Deanna the Drake, who activates her spirit
vision, will have RxLevel: Real Umbra and TxLevel: Real.  She will see
characters in Umbra and real world at the same time and perceive the

............................

Considering the config directives from example 2 and assuming a function
getstat(<dbref>,<stat>) that will return the value of a player’s stat
from the sheet here are softcode examples that implement some of the WoD
powers.  In a real game you would have to use some more checks, of
course.

+obf/on clears all TxLevels before setting the appropiate Obf @@ This is
necesary, because a character might advance from Obf2 to @@ Obf3 and he
should be visible /only/ on the Obf3 level.  @@ +obf/off simply sets the
Real Tx level, without clearing the Obf.  The @@ reason is the Mask.
Players with Obf3 or higher who use the Mask should @@ +obf/on, then

............................

While MUSHL_VARS are sanitized on what is allowable as a mush variable,
this is not necessarilly sanitized on what the calling script can fetch
as a valid variable.  Of note, you can not set environment variables
that contain an equals sign.  Be aware of this limitation.

Remember, MUSHL_VARS is the environment variable seen by the script.
This is EXECSCRIPT_VARS on the mush itself, that is the attribute set on
the target that contains the execscript() that is being executed.

So entering zones if there are no zones: -1

Entering zones if it has three zones (#123, #456, and #789) 123 456 789
-1

As you see, the last value of the zone `MUST' be -1.  This tells it that
there are no more zones to add.

     RhostMUSH 3.9.0 p00 Update File

          —- Notes —-

v3.9 is the development branch leading to RhostMUSH v4.0

     —- Changes —-

Fixed some mishandled signals which should not cause Rhost to panic
shutdown.  Added a Makefile define IGNORE_SIGNALS to turn off signal
handling entirely.  Changed Makefile to use RFC date (date -R) instead
of local datestring.  Updated version() to allow showing build number by
supplying an argument.  Added signal handling of SIGUSR1, SIGTERM,
SIGUSR2.  Added user configurable SIGUSR1 handling through
signal_object.  Added zones_like_parents for zones to search like
@parents.

        - this does require the ZONECMDCHK @toggle set on each
          item/player.

Modify snooplog to show site information.  Added %@ support to parser
(caller) - Penn/MUX/TM3 Added %+ support to parser (args sent to
functions) - Penn Added %?  support to parser (invocations) - Penn Added
NO_CODE flag for easier control of coding tool avaiability Added full

inconsistant for die() and dice().  - Changed /quiet switch to @notify.
Also added /quiet switch to @drain.

        - Thanks <Hellspawn@MUX2>

@cpattr modified so if no source given, assumes enactor (player) to be
source.  lattr() now takes 3rd argument.  ‘$’ for all $commands, ‘^’ for
listens.  /clear switch added to @toggle.  It only clears what you have
access to clear.  If there are more than 20 zones on an item, it
displays the dbref#’s only.  /## notation added to @site and all @admin
site information.  (0-32 range) ANSI highlight of @edit substitutions
added.  Follows NO_ANSI_EX toggle.  Multiple ‘types’ now allowed in
function remtype() On buffer problems, it records the line number and
file that it happened.  @list options handle sub-options now (config,
mail, boolean, values) Name field increased from 16 to 22 characters
(MUX2/TM3/PENN) /instant switch to @destroy (compatibility) - is the
‘default’ behavior.  (TM3) Immortals/#1 can use mail/recall to see mail
sent by others.  3rd argument to lrooms()’s to show level you’re in
(MUX2) LOGGING option to @flagdef.  Logs all setting/removing
(configurable) Allow specifying filename to @dump/flat (filename
restricted and ends in .flat)

        - Thanks <Reptile@CotM>

Modification to @lock/GetFrom to include target’s location as well.
Options added to mail[/read] for more flexability (ball, nall, uall)
Ports listing added to lwho() (boolean 1/0 - 0 (null) default) Ports
added to idle() (boolean 1/0 and optional specified port) Ports added to
conn() (boolean 1/0 and optional specified port) cmds() modified to
handle target port lattr() handles optional target of >>*<<player and
player now.

lnum() and lnum2() now can handle negative numbers.  @list options shows
if the COMMAND flag is used.  NOMODIFY can be configured to be
settable/unsettable/modifiable by imm only.  vector functions (vadd,
etc) that return a list now recognize output seps.  MAX_ARGS in
‘externs.h’ may be changed to increase the total number of arguments

     functions like switch() may take.  MAX_ARGS is currently defaulted
     to ‘30’ though MUX 2.0 has it set to ‘100’.  This HAS to be a
     compile time change else possible SIGSEGV’s could happen.

mail/write +editall=old,new - argument to mail/write added.  Modifies
ALL lines.  mail/write +feditall=old,new - modify ALL matches on ALL
lines.  mail/write +fedit #=old,new - modify ALL matches on given line.
mail/write +cc/+bcc=new - if FORWARDING or SENDING (not reply!)  will
allow the

     user to redefine who the message is being sent out to.

_ATTR can be compile-time added to be wiz-only settable/modifiable
attributes.  Modified mail/write +justify, +insert, +edit, +editall to
rehandle line count Made option to make harder password guessing.

1.19 Historical Non-Disclosure Agreement
========================================

The following NDA comes from the time when RhostMUSH was not publially
available.  It is preserved here for historical reasons.  We are suckers
for looking back at things.  :) –Ambrosia

       1. I agree, to not give out the code, in part or in full, in any
          form of medium, to anyone or anything not previously allowed
          by the developers.

       2. I agree, to not let others look at the code, in part or in
          full, in any form of medium, to anyone or anything not
          previously allowed by the developers.

       3. I am aware that any modifications I make to the code is
          _FULLY_ permitted, and that I do _NOT_ have to return said
          patches to the developers.

          Note: The Rhost developers would like to see what was added, and possibly

               look at adding them to the main distro if we see others
               would like it (with full credits to you), but we belive
               once you have the code, you should be allowed to play
               with it fully as long as the first two rules are kept.
