<div class="section" id="stack-limit-and-debugging">
<h2><span class="section-number">11.2. </span>Stack limit and debugging</h2>
<p>Rhost uses a stack limit in the debug monitor.</p>
<p>This stack limit is set to a reasonable amount of 1000.
This is defined in the debug.h file in the hdrs directory.</p>
<p>This will directly impact the function_recursion_limit from being
set above 100.  If, for whatever reason, you really must have
a ridiculously high recursion limit, then it is a suggestion to
manually modify the stack limit in debug.h to a higher number.</p>
<p>We have reasonably set it to 10000 without too much issue, but keep
in mind, the overhead is higher for every stack you throw on the
process table.  Higher stack means more memory used.</p>
<p>Also be aware that your shell stack limit directly is affected
to this value.</p>
<p>Type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ulimit</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will show you your shell stack limits.  Do NOT set the
STACKMAX value higher than your shell's stack value.</p>
<p>The value in ~/Rhost/Server/hdrs/debug.h is currently set as:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">#define STACKMAX 1000</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Feel free to change this to a higher value if you wish.</p>
<p>The caveat.  This effects the debug stack daemon.  Meaning,
the only way for this to be updated is through &#64;shutdown and
then a fresh ./Startmush.</p>
<p>A &#64;reboot WILL NOT LOAD IN A NEW DEBUG MONITOR!!!!</p>
<p>You can issue &#64;list stack to see the current stack ceiling ingame.</p>

<p>RhostMUSH automatically detects 64-bit platforms, and should compile
cleanly on these.</p>
<p>In case you are trying to compile Rhost on some other crazy-wide CPUs
such as the PS2, PS3 or other 128 or 256 bit CPUs, you can easily do
so by changing a few lines of code in conf.c.</p>
<p>change:</p>

<p>You should not have to worry about this, but incase something really
weird occurs, you may need to look into these changes...</p>
<p>The autoconfig.h file needs to have modifications to it by hand.</p>
<p>There are three manual entries:</p>
<p>This one sets how it defines the int to character pointer.  It's safe
to keep it as 'unsigned int' for 32 bit platforms.  For non 32-bit,
define it to  how an int is defined on that system:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">typedef</span> <span class="n">unsigned</span> <span class="nb">int</span>    <span class="n">pmath1</span><span class="p">;</span>

</div>
<p>This one sets how it defines the signed int to character pointer.  Same
restrictions apply as above for unsigned int:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This sets the allignment for the given platform.  4 represents a 32 bit
platform.  8 would represent a 64 bit platform, etc.  Change accordingly:</p>

<p>If you never touched the *database or muddb_name params, you should be good.</p>
<p>Verify your *database params (and muddb_name) are still set to 'netrhost' as
part of the name.  Ergo, the default values and you didn't change them.
These should match up with the filenames in your data directory.</p>
<p>If these names do not match up, it can't find the database files to load.
So you shouldn't have to change these names, ever. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="check-your-mush-config-file">
<h4><span class="section-number">11.5.1.3. </span>Check your mush.config file</h4>
<p>If you never modified this file, you should be good.</p>
<p>The gamename should be 'netrhost' for this file.  This does NOT control
the name of your game.  This controls the name of all the files
as associated to the mush.  So changing this means the netrhost.conf
file, all your database files, and so forth.  Please don't change this :)</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">11.5.2. </span>If the mush says it can't read or load your database files</h3>
<p>Double check everything for the previous issue. Make sure everything is named properly.</p>
<div class="section" id="verify-you-have-enough-disk-space-quota">
<h4><span class="section-number">11.5.2.1. </span>Verify you have enough disk space. (quota)</h4>
<p>Some account have a limited quota to run in.  If you reached or exceed
your disk quota, you can have a corrupted database.  So always keep
your eye on the size.  quota -s to see a human readable format to see
how much quota you have left.  You want to make sure current in use is
below the 'grace' and soft/hard limits shown.  If not, you're out of
space.</p>
<p>You will need to remove some files before you repair and bring up your
mush again.  Try to keep your quota at least 200 megs free to allow
plenty of wonderful growth space for the mush.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="verify-you-have-enough-disk-space-system">
<h4><span class="section-number">11.5.2.2. </span>Verify you have enough disk space.  (system)</h4>
<p>The second way you can run out of disk space is by the filesystem itself.
do a df -h . in your 'game' directory'.  That is df -h &lt;period&gt;.
This will return how much disk space is being used and how much remains.
If it shows 100% used, you're out of disk space and the db is corrupt.</p>
<p>At this point, you're pretty screwed.  You can see if anything exists
in your system to free up some space, but if the filesystem itself
is filled, reach out to the owner of the server and let them know.
It's a much bigger deal than just your mush if that's the case.</p>
<p>Until this issue is resolved, you can not repair and bring up your mush.
No disk to run the game.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">11.5.3. </span>If the mush seems to load fine but I can't log in anyone and when I do all the names and attributes of things seem to be gone!</h3>
<p>Ok, at this point you likely had your mush up when the physical server
went down hard.  Weither through an emergency shutdown or a physical
power outage, your db likely was brought down hard during a write,
so it left it in a corrupt state.  These things happen.  This is
why we always strongly request you make daily flatfile dumps.</p>
<p>So, to recover your database.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-bad-news">
<h4><span class="section-number">11.5.3.1. </span>The bad news</h4>
<p>If you have no flatfile backup or never bothered with backups?
I'm sorry, at this point you're SOA.  There's no easy way to
recover a corrupted binary database.  If you absolutely need
data out of it we may be able to help you to piece meal things
out of it, but otherwise it's a lost cause.  You'll have to start
over from scratch.  I'm sorry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-good-news">
<h4><span class="section-number">11.5.3.2. </span>The good news</h4>
<p>If you made backups, or if the server had a normal shutdown, you
likely have a flatfile backup.  You will see a netrhost.db.flat
in either the 'data' directory or 'prevflat' directory.  That
is your manual flatfile backup.</p>
<p>If the server had a normal shutdown, you will see a file called
netrhost.db.TERMFLAT.  This is a scram-emergency db flatfile.
It attempts to write this at the time of server shutdown to
hopefully keep a clean backup in the case of issues since
it identifies the server is coming down hard.  Make sure
if you plan to use the TERMFLAT as your recovery flatfile
that the very last line shows something like ** END OF DUMP **.
That shows you had a successful backup.</p>
