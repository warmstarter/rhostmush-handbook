<h2><span class="section-number">7.1. </span>Altering bitlevels</h2>
<p>Please keep in mind each of these bitlevels can be tweeked with the &#64;admin
parameters and with the &#64;powers (accessable by royalty) or &#64;depowers (only
by immortal and higher).</p>
<p>RhostMUSH offers a multi-tier bitlevel system.  They go in order of presidence
You do not have to use all these bits, only use what you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ghod-1-bitlevel-7">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.2. </span>ghod (#1) &lt;bitlevel 7&gt;</h2>
<p>This bitlevel can do everything.  Only those who you trust with absolute power should have this.  Period.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="immortal-i-level-6-basically-1">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.3. </span>Immortal(i) &lt;Level 6&gt; - Basically #1</h2>
<p>The only thing this bitlevel can not do is directly effect #1,
set/unset some internal flags/attributes, and set/unset the
immortal flag.  These players can do EVERYTHING else.  Treat
this bit as you would treat #1.  Only give it to those you know
without a doubt you can trust.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Can do everything except set some internal flags, effect #1, and set/remove the immortal flag.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="royalty-w-level-5-full-wizbit-level">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.4. </span>Royalty(W) &lt;Level 5&gt; - FULL wizbit level</h2>
<p>This is your standard wizard.  They can do everything you’re
used to on other mushes that wizards can do.  In addition, they
also override all locks by default (this can be disabled), and
they have an enhanced wizcloaking ability (which also can be
disabled).  They can also set all the lower bitlevels.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All things of Level 4 and lower</li>
<li>Ability to set more flags: STOP, NOSTOP, FUBAR</li>
<li>Ability to &#64;attribute,</li>
<li>Ability to WIZCLOAK</li>

<div class="section" id="councilor-a-level-4-high-wizbit-level">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.5. </span>Councilor(a) &lt;Level 4&gt; - High wizbit level</h2>
<p>This is your almost-but-not-quite wizard.  They have access to
about 80% of the wizard commands.  This includes &#64;nuke, &#64;toad,
&#64;newpassword and the like.  The only things they can’t do that
wizards can is cloak, override locks, and use some of the
database manipulation tools in wizhelp.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All things of Level 3 and lower</li>
<li>Ability to set more flags: NOCONNECT, WANDERER, FREE</li>
<li>Ability to &#64;nuke, &#64;toad, &#64;boot, &#64;chownall, &#64;dbck, &#64;poor, &#64;newpassword, &#64;pcreate, slay</li>

<div class="section" id="architect-b-level-3-middle-wizbit-level">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.6. </span>Architect(B) &lt;Level 3&gt; - Middle wizbit level</h2>
<p>This is your sub-wizard.  They still have the ability to control
anything their bitlevel and lower (including &#64;chown, &#64;destroy, etc)
but do not have any control of other players (like &#64;nuke, &#64;toad, etc)
but they can set the slave flag.  Otherwise, all things their level
and lower they can treat as if they owned it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All things of Level 2</li>
<li>Ability to fully control and modify anything their level and lower (including &#64;cloning, &#64;destroying, etc)</li>
<li>Ability to use &#64;tel on anything their level and lower.</li>
<li>Ability to bypass jump_ok rooms on anything their level &amp; lower.</li>

<div class="section" id="guildmaster-g-level-2-lowest-wizbit-level">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.7. </span>Guildmaster(g) &lt;Level 2&gt; - Lowest wizbit level</h2>
<p>This is the lowest wiz bit.  They only have moderate abilities.
They can examine/decompile anything their level and lower, they can
&#64;guild/&#64;quota people, and they have a few other minor abilities.
They don’t have free money however.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ability to access things remotely (long_fingers)</li>
<li>Things are FREE for them in the queue.</li>

<div class="section" id="wanderer-bitlevel-0">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.8. </span>Wanderer &lt;bitlevel 0&gt;</h2>
<p>This is a hinderance flag.  This flag is automatically set on new
players that are created (which can be disabled).  This flag stops
the player from creating/destroying any database information.   In
effect it stops them from any type of building type commands.  They
still are allowed to set/unset locks/attributes/etc though without
hinderance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guest-bitlevel-0-as-well">
<h2><span class="section-number">7.9. </span>Guest &lt;bitlevel 0 as well&gt;</h2>
<p>This is a bigger hinderance flag.  By default all guests should be
set this.  This flag stops the player from ANY database manipulation
along with &#64;teleporting, and many other advanced commands.  It’s
extreamly dehibilatating.</p>
