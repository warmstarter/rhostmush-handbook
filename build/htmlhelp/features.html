<h1><span class="section-number">2. </span>What RhostMUSH is about and what’s so great about RhostMUSH</h1>
<p>RhostMUSH was founded in 1989, originally by Natasha Davis (Nyctasia) and as
a branch from the original release of TinyMUD code.  It was her desire to make
a game that was flexible, with multiple levels of progression and highly
customizeable.  She lost time and interest and passed the game to
Steve Shivers (Seawolf), Mike McDermott (Thorin), and Jace Hoppel (Ashen-Shugar)</p>
<p>Through their work, the stability improved, we fixed it to be multi-platform
and as bug free as we could possibly make it.  We introduced several methods both
in game and in source that allowed consistent memory bounds checking and
various alerts for any mischievous naughtyness in-game or possibilities of any
hacks, patches, or alterations in the code causing leaks or issues.</p>
<p>While not perfect, it has allowed us to have an absolutely outstanding
turn around for any bugs sent our way, which anyone who uses RhostMUSH will
attest to.</p>
<p>Over the years, others have joined the RhostMUSH team, including Ambrosia
(who is the current dev lead), Lensman, Kage (who kindly provided the
UTF8/unicode port), Jeff/Loki, Rook, Noltar, and Odin.</p>
<p>We also have had hundreds of people who have offered (and provided) help,
patches, suggestions, bug fixes, and alternations all on their own and
every single one will have had their name mentioned in the RHOST.CHANGES
file in the readme directory.  It’s far too large to have in the online
help files.</p>
<p>RhostMUSH today provides an amazing tool that allows nearly entire
customization in-game of every single feature available in Rhost without
having the requirement to modify the hardcode.  This includes but is
not limited to:</p>
<div class="section" id="recycle-bin">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.1. </span>Recycle bin</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Yup, you guessed it.  RhostMUSH has a windows like recycle bin.
This means the objects you &#64;nuke and &#64;destroy become ‘destroyed’
but not recycled until they are &#64;purged.  If you use the Myrddin
CRON in the Mushcode directory, it by default sets up a job
to purge anything over 30 days old, which should be more than
sufficient for any needs.  The goodness of this?  You can recover
nuked things from any period of time, as long as they were not
&#64;purged first.</p>

<li>override all locks.  There’s two flags to disable this.
NO_OVERRIDE to stop overriding all locks (including attribs)
and NO_USELOCK to just stop overriding uselocks.
This applies to anything their level and lower.</li>
<li>optionally cloak from all non-immortals/God player.
This can be highly abused if not careful and there
is a &#64;depower to disable cloaking and/or dark that will
disable this.</li>
<li>immortals can optionally supercloak from even wizards.
this can not be disabled, and you must consider that immortals
should be treated as the God player (#1) since they are
effectively #1 in nearly every way.</li>

softcode override.  You may also use &#64;Hook for altering how

considered the #1 character in most cases and is bitlevel 6.  Then
the royalty character, which is equal to wizard on penn, mux, or
other codebases.  For most things, this is the bitlevel you want
to assign players.  The exception will likely be game owners or
people who control the master room code.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>While using QDBM, there’s really no set limits for most things.
The limits that we have are as followed:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>LBUF - 64K.  It is recommended to only use 32K as there is some issues with networking with 64K lbufs.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Compile time option with the menu configurator</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>SBUF - 64 characters (if configured – it’s suggested you do).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Compile time option with the menu configurator</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>MBUF - 200 characters.  Not able to be changed.</p>
<p>MAX CONNECTIONS - Limited by the total number of open sockets and descriptors on the account and server running on.  There are various tools to limit connection DoS attemps and other such nastiness.  This is well documented in the netrhost.conf file.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>wizhelp max_players</li>
<li>~/game/netrhost.conf</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>MEMORY - no limit.  Generally runs between 8-50M depending on the size of the mush and the LBUF size specified.</p>
<p>CPU  - no limit, but has built in cpu abort in code.  The netrhost.conf file documents this well for customizing.  the default values are usually good enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>wizhelp max_cpu_cycles</li>
<li>wizhelp cpuintervalchk</li>
<li>wizhelp cputimechk</li>
<li>wizhelp cpu_secure_lvl</li>
<li>wizhelp heavy_cpu_max</li>
<li>~/game/netrhost.conf</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>DISK - no limit.  Generally will be 75-200M depending on size, number of backups and if you leave your compiled object files in.</p>
<p>DB Size - (20000 default) There is no limit on the number of objects the db can have.  By default it’s soft limited to 20K objects, which can be changed by a netrhost.conf file change.  We have had this up past 1.5 million objects, and other than a second or two of lag for complex searches we had no real problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>wizhelp maximum_size</li>
<li>help &#64;quota</li>
<li>wizhelp &#64;quota</li>
<li>wizhelp &#64;limit</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Attribute Size - 10K as a hard limit.  750 as a soft limit.  You can increase this but it can’t exceed 10000 attributes.  This is to avoid DoS style attacks.</p>
