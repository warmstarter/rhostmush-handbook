a player should belong to a BC-Houston-Powered that is &#64;powered
EXAMINE_ALL, LONG_FINGERS And TEL_ANYTHING on Guildmaster level.
If the object actually needs to modify a player directly, have
it use a restricted staff Global, or if you absolutely must,
make a BC-Houston-Admin and &#64;set it Architect. Do not give
normal builders access to it, only &#64;chown things to it and &#64;set

<p>If you as the MU* Head(s) don't know Softcode well, or want to
leave anything Code to your Head Coder, also give them optional
access to a maintenance Royalty bit in order to properly code
banning/blacklisting +commands and other rare code that requires
Royalty powers. Again, chown finished code to bc-admin-royalty.</p>

<p>They already have more powers than any in-game bit can ever

<p>Depending on actual involvement with your game, their abilities
in-game can range from merely being &#64;powered free_wall for
notifying players of downtimes and/or being &#64;powered shutdown in
order to shut down the game for maintenance, up to being the
only person with actual access to #1.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ambrosiadb-globals">
<h2><span class="section-number">10.5. </span>AmbrosiaDB Globals</h2>
<p>Handle necessary functionality for adminning through the admin-only globals and
softcode.</p>
<p>The setup I personally suggest is to have ALL staffers be AT MAX Architect-level
for everyday work and communication, with special coders that -really- require
it having Councilor-characters available to log into for maintenance or special
code setup. Technically if everything is done right, the Coder(s) of the game do
not require higher privileges than Architect for the vast majority of things.
Royalty-level code should be a rare exception, if at all necessary. The MU*
Head(s) or site-admin should be the only one having access to #1, Immortals or
perhaps even Royalty. The BC's, Global Function objects and Function objects at
level Royalty and higher have simply been provided as a if-necessary convenience.</p>
<p>Current objects are only &#64;chowned to certain bitlevels if it is really required
for them to function. Whenever possible, they have been &#64;chowned to the mortal
BC-Admin-Mortal. All custom global functions listed above are on the semi-
-mortal Global Functions object. The Master Room and Auxiliary Room have been
&#64;chowned to BC-Admin-Architect.</p>
<p>The Comsystem and +bboard are owned by BC-Admin-Architect, which means that
higher bitlevels might not be able to use those systems if they hide and set
themselves DARK. This is intentional. The Architect bitlevel is enough to freely
set attributes on players, so these systems did not need anything higher, and
it prioritizes Councilor+ as mere mainenance-duty bitlevels. Even the MU* Head
should log on as an Architect for everyday things.</p>
<p>The Comsystem and BBOARD have been modified to be configurable by Architect and
higher. Both systems have a CANUSE attribute with the according code on them.
Note that if you want both systems to be only configurable by Councilor+, that
instead of &#64;chowning them to a Councilor after changing those attribute for
Councilor or higher, I suggest to simply &#64;set the bboard and comsystem core
objects NO_MODIFY instead, keeping them at Architect-power but making them
unmodifyable by Architects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ambrosiadb-quota">
<h2><span class="section-number">10.6. </span>AmbrosiaDB Quota</h2>
<p>I highly recommend the use of the alternative &#64;quota system. BC-Admin-Mortal
and BC-Admin-Guildmaster both have this &#64;quota system set up on themselves. Both
of them have a high amount of money for everyday operations. You should not give
them free quota or money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ambrosiadb-adding-functions">
<h2><span class="section-number">10.7. </span>AmbrosiaDB Adding Functions</h2>
<p>I also recommend to setup most global functions with /Privileged even if they
are mortal-powered, to make them work even when players are set NO_CODE and
WANDERER by default.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
