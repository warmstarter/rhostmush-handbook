RhostMUSH Handbook
==================

The RhostMUSH source tree offers many abilities and options
not normally found in any other flavor of mush.  This doesn't
make it better than other servers (though we think so *j/k*)
but it does give you a wider selection of configurability,
which, as you know, is the best part of setting up a mush.
(yea, right)

*  A high-performance dual-quota system.
*  A complete rewrite of key areas and referbishments of all the other areas.
*  An on-line recover tool for accidental db destruction.
*  Multi-wizard architecture for better control of staff.
*  Multi-power system to tweek abilities of players.
*  Multi-zone system where people can belong to multiple zones.
*  Built in error correction for db corruption or other misuse.
*  Built in accounting for those annoying twinks who try to hack.
*  Many new functions and commands not seen anywhere else.
*  A lot more that could drag this document out for pages.
