Variable                   Description
MUSH_PLAYER                player dbref# 
MUSH_CAUSE                 cause dbref#
MUSH_CALLER                caller dbref#
MUSH_OWNER                 owner of player dbref#
MUSH_FLAGS                 space delimited list of flags on player

MUSHL_VARS                 space delimited list of MUSH attributes from player
                           This is passed from the mush's EXECSCRIPT_VARS attr
Dynamic variables
+++++++++++++++++

MUSHV_<arg>                <arg> variable passed from MUSHL_VARS
                           These are the attributes from EXECSCRIPT_VARS

Register variables
++++++++++++++++++

MUSHQ_<arg>                setq registers 0-9 and a-z
MUSHQN_<arg>               labels that are assigned the setq vars
MUSHN_<arg>                The labels that were defined by any register
                           Note: they must be ASCII-7 clean and contain no
                                 white spaces


set object
----------

The script executed with execscript() will read in a file with the same name
as the script ending in '.set'.  This is a loader object that will set attributes
and registers back into the mush that you wish to pass from the script. The
fields are SPACE SEPARATED.  The values are NOT evaluated.

The format of the fields are

Dynamic variables
"""""""""""""""""

VARNAME        OWNER        CONTENTS (or leave null to clear)

Examples
''''''''

SEX #123 Male
DESC #123 %r%tThis is a willow tree of unique description%r%rIt sways in the wind.
RED #123 This is the color %ch%crred%cn.
WIPETHISATTR #123
MULTILINE #123 This is a line
that continues on
because of the line feed (a control-M) on each line
on the lines above

Register variables
""""""""""""""""""

REGISTER       Q            CONTENTS (or leave null to clear)

Examples (The last example clears register 0)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

W Q This is stored in register W
1 Q This is stored in register 1
0 Q
foo QN this sets register with label 'foo'


Example bash script
-------------------

#!/bin/bash
echo "This was called by player ${MUSH_PLAYER} that is owned by ${MUSH_OWNER}"
echo "Displaying Registers:"
regs="0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z"
for list in ${regs}
do
   eval echo "Register ${list}: \${MUSHQ_${list}}"
done
echo "Displaying variables:"
for vars in ${MUSHL_VARS}
do
    eval echo "Variable ${vars}: \${MUSHV_${vars}}"
done


Notes and warnings
------------------

While MUSHL_VARS are sanitized on what is allowable as a mush variable, this
is not necessarilly sanitized on what the calling script can fetch as a valid
variable.  Of note, you can not set environment variables that contain an
equals sign.  Be aware of this limitation.

Remember, MUSHL_VARS is the environment variable seen by the script.
This is EXECSCRIPT_VARS on the mush itself, that is the attribute set
on the target that contains the execscript() that is being executed.
