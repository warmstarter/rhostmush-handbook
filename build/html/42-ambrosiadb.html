<p>Greetings,
This minimal Rhost DB was made with a secure setup, and as a good base to start
a new game off in mind.</p>
<p>It offers the following features:
* Limbo, Master Room and Auxiliary room.
* BC-Admin-&lt;bitlevel&gt; characters set up for each bitlevel to own global and</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>data objects, and inherit to.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>BC-Admin-Mortal is &#64;powered EXAMINE_ALL(Guildmaster), NOFORCE(Architect) and
LONG_FINGERS.</p></li>
<li><p>&#64;startup on BC-Admin-Immortal lowers DARK flag access to Councilor level, and
NO_CODE visual access to Architect level.</p></li>
<li><p>Global Command objects inheriting from each bitlevel, with a separate staff-
-only object for each level.</p></li>
<li><p>Global Function objects inheriting from each bitlevel.</p></li>
<li><p>local Function objects inheriting from each bitlevel.</p></li>
<li><p>&#64;function and &#64;hook access lowered to Royalty level to remove immediate need
for Immortals or actual Immortal code.</p></li>
<li><p>&#64;rxlevel, &#64;txlevel, bittype() access lowered to Architect level to remove
immediate need for Royalty in many cases.</p></li>
<li><p>&#64;startup on BC-Admin-Royalty to automatically load &#64;hooks and &#64;functions from
the Global Function objects, based on attribute naming.</p></li>
<li><p>Misc Data object to hold general data, like Staff lists etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Reality levels ‘Real’ and ‘Admin’.
All created items and players by default are in Recieve-Level ‘Real’ and
Transmit-Levels ‘Real’ and ‘Admin’.</p></li>
<li><p>All globals, Master Room, BCs-<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>, and other staff/code-related objects
currently have only ‘Admin’ as their Transmit-Level. This does not prevent
them fromi working properly. The only exception is #1, who has empty reality
levels.</p></li>
<li><p>The supplied netrhost.conf offers a secure setup of options, allows Royalty
to use &#64;hook and &#64;function, and also sets the function_access of several
functions to !no_code, which allows NO_CODE players to use the comsys
properly.
IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use this .conf as a base for this DB.
The ‘Port’ configuration parameter is XXXX’d out. Set it first before starting
your game.</p></li>
<li><p>All existing objects have been &#64;set SAFE and INDESTRUCTABLE.</p></li>
<li><p>All existing objects have a paranoid series of &#64;locks set on themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>The +supersafe command is provided on #1 as an example of what was used to
easily set this on objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Players are &#64;set NO_CODE and WANDERER by default. They get 40 credits on
creation, and a 1-credit-per-day paycheck.</p></li>
<li><p>All <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">*</span></a>mit sideeffects, as well as set(), create() and list() are enabled. The
latter three are necessary for the Comsystem. The rest of sideeffects are
disabled completely.</p></li>
<li><p>Flashing ansi is disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>_Attributes are settable by Architects, and seeable by Guildmasters. Read:
Still invisible and unsettable by mortals.</p></li>
<li><p>Architects can set up, unlock, and change alternate &#64;quota on players.</p></li>
<li><p>Architects can set/unset the NO_CODE flag.</p></li>
<li><p>Guildmasters can see _Attributes</p></li>
<li><p>Architects can set _Attributes</p></li>
<li><p>Set-up compatibility SoftFunctions and &#64;hook object.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up Comsys 1.0.9b at Architect level. (+bbhelp command)</p></li>
<li><p>Set up Myrddin +bboard at Architect level.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up Myrddon Cron at Architect level.</p></li>
<li><p>Anomaly Jobs (+jhelp)</p></li>
<li><p>SGP Places &amp; Mutter</p></li>
<li><p>Set up Penn-style follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up &#64;scan (Up to architect-level items).</p></li>
<li><p>Set up Penn- and Mux compatibility Mailwrappers. (phelp and mhelp commands)</p></li>
<li><p>help .txt files and .indx files for the above.</p></li>
<li><p>&#64;dynhelp access lowered to architect to call above helpfiles.</p></li>
<li><p>isstaff() - Softcoded function that returns ‘1’ if its argument matches
a #dbref in the ‘isstaff’ attribute on the Misc Data object.</p></li>
<li><p>bccheck() - Softcoded function that returns ‘1’ if its argument matches
a #dbref in the ‘bcs’ attribute on the Misc Data object.</p></li>
<li><p>width() - Softcoded function that returns 78 for now. For cross-MU*
compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>pass() - Softcoded function that takes a number as its parameter, and return
a random string of that length. Perfect for setting random passwords.</p></li>
<li><p>cmdmessage() - Softcoded function that takes two strings as its parameters.
Returns ‘&lt;&lt; STRING1 &gt;&gt; String2’. The &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; part is highlighted red. Good for
all kinds of messages sent by game commands.</p></li>
<li><p>header() - Highly versatile, and a buffer-saving alternative
to using printf() for centering with ansi borders. HIGHLY recommended to use
instead of printf() for such things.
header(text,width,filler,fillercolor,outerpadding,paddingcolor,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>leftinnerpadding,leftinnercolor,rightinnerpadding,rightinnercolor)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>text - Text to center
width - Width of the header, defaults to width()
filler - Character(s) to draw the line with. Default: =
fillercolor - ansicode to color the line with
outerpadding - Characters to frame the outer ends of the line with.
paddingcolor - ansicode to color the outer characters with
leftinnerpadding - characters to put at the left side of &lt;text&gt;
leftinnercolor - ansicode to color the leftside characters with
rightinnerpadding - characters to put at the right side of &lt;text&gt;
rightinnercolor - ansicode to color the rightside characters with</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>ALL of header()’s parameters are optional. By default, header() simply draws
a 78-char wide line of =’s. Simply leave parameters empty if you want to set
one of the latter parameters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole DB is highly geared for a low-bitlevel setup.
I am a strong believer in least-privileges-needed to do the job. Bittypes and
powers are tools to do that job, not badges of friendship or trust that get
tossed about.</p>
<p>Here is my suggested list of powers and bittypes for staffers:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Storytellers  - &#64;powered TEL_ANYWHERE, JOIN_PLAYER and GRAB_PLAYER on</dt><dd><p>Guildmaster level.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Builder-BCs   - Mortal, with &#64;quota and money for their job. There should be one</dt><dd><p>shared BC for each area of the game, like BC-Houston. Special
Rooms, items or exits that require privilegs to examine or &#64;tel
a player should belong to a BC-Houston-Powered that is &#64;powered
EXAMINE_ALL, LONG_FINGERS And TEL_ANYTHING on Guildmaster level.
If the object actually needs to modify a player directly, have
it use a restricted staff Global, or if you absolutely must,
make a BC-Houston-Admin and &#64;set it Architect. Do not give
normal builders access to it, only &#64;chown things to it and &#64;set
them inherit after review.
Both the -powered and -admin BCs can have random passwords and
be &#64;set NO_CONNECT.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Building Head - &#64;set Guildmaster, powered TEL_ANYWHERE, TEL_ANYTHING and</dt><dd><p>optionally CHOWN_OTHER on Guildmaster level. Mind that the
latter technically allows them to &#64;chown anything guildmaster-
and lower-owned in the master and auxiliary rooms. However,
it allows the Building Head to &#64;chown items between BCs- and
to the BC-&lt;location&gt;-powered.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Enforcers     - As Storyteller above, plus being &#64;powered Security at</dt><dd><p>Guildmaster level, in order to handle problem players.
Optionally always given to Storytellers.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Coders        - &#64;set Architect.
Head Coder    - Always trust your head coder.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>&#64;set Architect for the everyday bit. Give access to a
maintenance Councilor bit for special code projects. Finished
code along those lines should get &#64;chowned to the
bc-admin-councilor.
If you as the MU* Head(s) don’t know Softcode well, or want to
leave anything Code to your Head Coder, also give them optional
access to a maintenance Royalty bit in order to properly code
banning/blacklisting +commands and other rare code that requires
Royalty powers. Again, chown finished code to bc-admin-royalty.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>MU* Head(s)   - You’re the boss(es). But please use an Architect bit for your</dt><dd><p>everyday things. Keep Immortal to yourself. Keep #1 to yourself.
And seriously avoid using either of them except for creating
a Royalty bit or doing intricate DB maintenance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Site Admins   - They already have more powers than any in-game bit can ever</dt><dd><p>have ;)
Depending on actual involvement with your game, their abilities
in-game can range from merely being &#64;powered free_wall for
notifying players of downtimes and/or being &#64;powered shutdown in
order to shut down the game for maintenance, up to being the
only person with actual access to #1.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Handle necessary functionality for adminning through the admin-only globals and
softcode.</p>
<p>The setup I personally suggest is to have ALL staffers be AT MAX Architect-level
for everyday work and communication, with special coders that -really- require
it having Councilor-characters available to log into for maintenance or special
code setup. Technically if everything is done right, the Coder(s) of the game do
not require higher privileges than Architect for the vast majority of things.
Royalty-level code should be a rare exception, if at all necessary. The MU*
Head(s) or site-admin should be the only one having access to #1, Immortals or
perhaps even Royalty. The BC’s, Global Function objects and Function objects at
level Royalty and higher have simply been provided as a if-necessary convenience.</p>
<p>Current objects are only &#64;chowned to certain bitlevels if it is really required
for them to function. Whenever possible, they have been &#64;chowned to the mortal
BC-Admin-Mortal. All custom global functions listed above are on the semi-
-mortal Global Functions object. The Master Room and Auxiliary Room have been
&#64;chowned to BC-Admin-Architect.</p>
<p>The Comsystem and +bboard are owned by BC-Admin-Architect, which means that
higher bitlevels might not be able to use those systems if they hide and set
themselves DARK. This is intentional. The Architect bitlevel is enough to freely
set attributes on players, so these systems did not need anything higher, and
it prioritizes Councilor+ as mere mainenance-duty bitlevels. Even the MU* Head
should log on as an Architect for everyday things.</p>
<p>The Comsystem and BBOARD have been modified to be configurable by Architect and
higher. Both systems have a CANUSE attribute with the according code on them.
Note that if you want both systems to be only configurable by Councilor+, that
instead of &#64;chowning them to a Councilor after changing those attribute for
Councilor or higher, I suggest to simply &#64;set the bboard and comsystem core
objects NO_MODIFY instead, keeping them at Architect-power but making them
unmodifyable by Architects.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the use of the alternative &#64;quota system. BC-Admin-Mortal
and BC-Admin-Guildmaster both have this &#64;quota system set up on themselves. Both
of them have a high amount of money for everyday operations. You should not give
them free quota or money.</p>
<p>I also recommend to setup most global functions with /Privileged even if they
are mortal-powered, to make them work even when players are set NO_CODE and
WANDERER by default.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>P.S. the ‘bin/asksource.save0’ file has been supplied for loading in the
‘make config’ or ‘make confsource’ step of Rhost installation. It provides the
settings I have used when creating this database. Some settings, like the ANSI
substitution, are used in the DB.</p>
