Considerations to locking down restrictions in RhostMUSH
********************************************************

Sometimes, you want to have things run at various privilage levels and
do not want to have things with too much access.  Weither that is
online objects or players you want to block from connecting to your
mush.  Here’s things you can do.

One thing to keep in mind is that RhostMUSH, unlike PennMUSH is not
flag dependant on permission level, it’s ownership based.  While
setting a wizard flag on an object would work, it’s not recommended
and it is instead recommended to chown the object in question to a
wizard (like your wizard holder character) Then the object must be set
inherit to actually inherit the wizard.

Note: inherit is required to inherit anything from the player.  Flags,
powers,
   toggles.  The only thing that is inherited automatically is
   depowers.


Online: Blocking object abilities
=================================

We have various flag levels.  It is strongly recommanded you check
wizhelp on ‘control’ for a detailed overview of what each bitlevel can
or can not do prior to giving the ownership to the object.  Things
useful for tweaking control on players and objects:


FLAGS (access with @set)

   SIDEFX, NO_CONNECT, WANDERER, SAFE, AUDITORIUM, BACKSTAGE,
   NOBACKSTAGE, INDESTRUCTIBLE, INHERIT, JUMP_OK, NO_TEL, NO_WALL,
   NO_EXAMINE, NO_MODIFY, NO_CONNECT, NO_POSSESS, NO_PESTER,

Please review help (and wizhelp) for each of these items on how it can
affect a player, thing, exit, or room.  The help is quite verbose.
