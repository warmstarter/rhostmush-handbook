11.1. Considerations to locking down restrictions in RhostMUSH
==============================================================

Sometimes, you want to have things run at various privilage levels and
do not want to have things with too much access.  Weither that is
online objects or players you want to block from connecting to your
mush.  Here's things you can do.

One thing to keep in mind is that RhostMUSH, unlike PennMUSH is not
flag dependant on permission level, it's ownership based.  While
setting a wizard flag on an object would work, it's not recommended
and it is instead recommended to chown the object in question to a
wizard (like your wizard holder character) Then the object must be set
inherit to actually inherit the wizard.

Note:

  inherit is required to inherit anything from the player.  Flags,
  powers, toggles.  The only thing that is inherited automatically is
  depowers.


11.1.1. Online: Blocking object abilities
-----------------------------------------

We have various flag levels.  It is strongly recommanded you check
wizhelp on 'control' for a detailed overview of what each bitlevel can
or can not do prior to giving the ownership to the object.  Things
useful for tweaking control on players and objects.


11.1.1.1. FLAGS (access with @set)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   IMMORTAL, ROYALTY, COUNCILOR, ARCHITECT, GUILDMASTER,
   FUBAR, SLAVE, SIDEFX, NO_CONNECT, WANDERER, SAFE,
   AUDITORIUM, BACKSTAGE, NOBACKSTAGE, INDESTRUCTIBLE,
   INHERIT, JUMP_OK, NO_TEL, NO_WALL, NO_EXAMINE,
   NO_MODIFY, NO_CONNECT, NO_POSSESS, NO_PESTER,
   NO_OVERRIDE, NO_USELOCK, NO_MOVE, NO_YELL, CLOAK,
   SCLOAK, DARK, UNFINDABLE, SEE_OEMIT, TELOK, SUSPECT,
   SPAMMONITOR


11.1.1.2. TOGGLES (@toggle)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   BRANDY_MAIL, PENN_MAIL, MUXPAGE, VPAGE, NOISY,
   MONITOR* (all monitor toggles), MORTALREALITY,
   NODEFAULT, NO_FORMAT, PAGELOCK, SNUFFDARK, VARIABLE


11.1.1.3. @powers, @depowers, and @locks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please review help (and wizhelp) for each of these items on how it can
affect a player, thing, exit, or room.  The help is quite verbose.


11.1.2. Offline: Blocking twinks from being abusive on your game
----------------------------------------------------------------

   FLAGS                   : FUBAR, SLAVE, NO_CONNECT
   Commands:               : @boot, @nuke, @toad, @turtle
   Sitelocks: (@admin)     : forbid_host, forbid_site, register_host, register_site, noguest_host, noguest_site
   Sitelock by player      : @badsite, @goodsite, NO_CONNECT (flag)
   Monitoring player       : SUSPECT (flag), @snoop
   TOR/Proxy blocking:     : @blacklist (see shell's tor_pull.sh), @admin proxy_checker (see wizhelp), @tor (see wizhelp)


11.2. Extended lockdown of the mush and considerations
======================================================

These are flags, powers, toggles, and various conditions for
consideration when you decide to use some of the advanced features of
RhostMUSH. These are not all that is availble, but tend to be the
juicier ones to consider.


11.2.1. Attribute Restriction
-----------------------------

   @attribute -- Used for user-defined attributes
   @admin attr_access -- used for built in attributes (like desc)
   @aflags -- Used to set up lovely delicious attribute permission masks


11.2.2. Command Restriction
---------------------------

   @icmd    - Very useful.   Please see wizhelp on it.  It disallows commands from executing including overriding them with softcode alternatives
   @admin access - Changes permissions, disables, or sets to be overridden a command.  Useful when you plan to override commands with softcode.


11.2.3. Flag/Toggle Restriction
-------------------------------

   @flagdef - Again, see wizhelp on this.  There are also netrhost.conf options so you can have them loaded at start.  This allows tweaking flags and toggles to who can set/unset/see as well as what type can use it or wha type it can be used on.


11.2.4. Config restrictions
---------------------------

   @admin config_access - Changes permission of who can set a config param


11.2.5. Function Restrictions
-----------------------------

   @function/@lfunction -- Allows softcoded functions that you can optionally lock down at your leasure
   @admin function_access -- You can use this even on softcoded functions if you so desired.


11.2.6. RhostMUSH Flags and Descriptions
----------------------------------------

   GUEST       - This is your guest flag, it should only be set on guests
   WANDERER    - the WANDERER flag is default on new players.  This flag disables all building abilitites of the player.
   NO_COMMAND  - You can use this to stop a player from being able to connect without worrying about changing their password
   FUBAR       - As the flag states, it f*'s them up beind all recognition.  It essentially stops them from doing absolutely anything in the mush but pose and say.  Yes, it even disables the quit command.
   SLAVE       - Funny enough, slave allows anything but say and pose.  To ruin a troll's life, set both FUBAR and SLAVE and sit back and smile.
   NO_TEL      - The target can't teleport or be teleported
   NO_MOVE     - The target is locked at their location unable to move at all
   NO_WALL     - They do not see any @wall except a wizard @wall/no_prefix.  This has the bonus of snuffing db save messages.
   NO_POSSESS  - Sometimes it's useful to grant a builder character to multiple players.  The NO_POSSESS flag makes it so that player can not be logged in more than 2 times.
   NO_MODIFY   - The target can not be modified (except by immortal/#1)
   NO_EXAMINE  - The target can not be examined/decompiled (except by immortal/#1)
   STOP        - Once a matching $command is found on an object set STOP, it 'stops' trying to find other $command matches.
   NOSTOP      - If a target that is set STOP is also set NOSTOP, it will check the master room for a command and execute that as well if found.
   NO_PESTER   - Stops target from @pemit or whisper.  You may use @icmd as well.
   NO_OVERRIDE - Useful for immortals.  By default they override all locks, including attribute locks.  This makes it so an immortal's passing of locks will behave like a mortals
   NO_USELOCK  - This is like NO_OVERRIDE but only effects uselocks.  You likely want to set this on your immortal and wizard.
   NO_ANSINAME - stops a target from having an ansified name
   NO_CODE     - lock down advanced coding from a target
   SPAMMONITOR - stop a target from issuing more than 60 commands a minute.
   FREE        - Stop costing money for day to day processing of commands/building

11.2.10. Site Restrictions
--------------------------

   These are accessable via the @admin command, and the following
   options are allowable.

   You may see all site information at any time with: @list sites


11.2.10.1. IP based restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You may use CIDR notation such as /32 instead of 255.255.255.255.
   Config file:  (see section on forbid_site as it describes and gives
   examples) Online Syntax: MASK:

                      @admin forbid_site=123.123.123.0 255.255.255.0
                      @admin forbid_site=123.123.123.123 255.255.255.255

      CIDR::

                      @admin forbid_site=123.123.123.0 /24
                      @admin forbid_site=123.123.123.123 /32

      REMOVING: MASK::

                      @site/all 123.123.123.123=255.255.255.255
                      @site/forbid 123.123.123.0=254.255.255.0

                CIDR::

                      @site/all 123.123.123.123=/32
                      @site/forbid 123.123.123.0=/24

   forbid_site      - Set the specified site forbid only
   register_site    - Set the specified site register only
   noguest_site     - Set the specified site unable to connect to guests
   suspect_site     - Set the specified site suspect on connect
   noautoreg_site   - Set the specified site to not allow autoregistration
   trust_site       - Allow site to bypass suspect site restrictions
   permit_site      - Allow site to bypass sitelock restrictions
   nodns_site       - Site will no longer do reverse DNS lookups
   noauth_site      - Site will no longer do AUTH ident lookups


11.2.10.2. DNS based restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   These allow globbing wildcard matches. The advanced feature is you
   can specify filtering on when the condition is matched, such as
   allowing 2 players from a site to be connected before disallowing
   anyone else to connect. Config File: (see section on forbid_host as
   it describes and gives examples) Online Syntax:

      ADD:      @admin forbid_host=*.dsl*.comcast.net *.aol.com *another.site
      DEL:      @admin forbid_host=!*.aol.com
      ADVANCED: @admin forbid_host=mudconnect.com|3 (allow 3 at once only)

   forbid_host     - Set the specified site(s) forbid only
   register_host   - Set the specified site(s) register only
   noguest_host    - Set the specified site(s) unable to connect to guests
   suspect_host    - Set the specified site(s) suspect on connect
   noautoreg_host  - Set the specified site(s) to not allow autoregistration
   validate_host   - Do not allow any autoregistration from emails matching site
   goodmail_host   - Always allow autoregistration from emails matching site
   nobroadcast_host - Snuff online site broadcasts via MONITOR for specified site


11.3. Methods to block anonymous connections and the pros and cons of doing so
==============================================================================

   Now let's assume you have some troll attempting to use proxies to
   connect. There's multiple ways to stop this.


11.3.1. Blacklisting through external tor_pull.sh script
--------------------------------------------------------

   In ~/Rhost/Server/game you will see a script called tor_pull.sh
   Execute this by running (from the game directory) ./tor_pull.sh
   This populates the blacklist with registered proxies from various
   sites on the internet.  If you want specified ip's added, feel free
   to add them at the end of this file.


11.3.2. Blacklisting through internal @blacklist command
--------------------------------------------------------

   On the mush, have as part of your startup @blacklist/load This will
   load in the generated blacklist file for automatic forbid sites
   based on the ip.


11.3.3. Blacklisting through internal @tor command
--------------------------------------------------

   @tor.  Please see 'wizhelp tor' on how to set this up.  It in
   effect will actively block all known exit nodes for TOR's
   annonymous proxy service.  It self-updates and will actively block
   TOR connections.


11.3.4. Blacklisting through internal @admin command
----------------------------------------------------

   @admin proxy_checker (please see wizhelp) This little doodad uses
   MTU checking against packet size which will detect most methods of
   proxies.  Sadly, this also has false positives because some
   situations require a differentating MTU value such as briged
   network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or similar
   encapsulated network services.  However, this option has several
   settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies to
   downright forbidding them.  If you're being actively attacked, it
   may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection.
