How to convert a database from another mush to RhostMUSH
********************************************************


Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH
===================================================

In the ~/Server/convert directory there is a script called
‘doconvert.sh’

This script will convert most flatfiles from existing mush engines to
RhostMUSH.  The exception is PennMUSH 1.8.0 and later.  For this there
is a BETA converter penn18x_converter.tgz.  This is proven to work,
most of the time, with codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not
been fully vetted with the latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies.

To convert a non-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you
first need a valid flatfile of the game you’re wanting to convert.
Please refer to the documentatation of the mush engine in question
(MUX, Penn 1.7, TM2/3) on how to do this.  Once you have it type:

./doconvert.sh FLATFILETOCONVERT FLATFILEOUTPUT

In this instance, FLATFILETOCONVERT will be the filename (with full
path) to the flatfile you are wishing to convert.

The FLATFILEOUTPUT is anyfilename you wish to name the RhostMUSH
converted flatfile.  I suggest netrhost_converted.db.flat so you know
by the name what it is.

Follow what it asks for and just let it do its thing.
