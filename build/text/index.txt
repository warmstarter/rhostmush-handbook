RhostMUSH Handbook

The RhostMUSH source tree offers many abilities and options not
normally found in any other flavor of mush.  This doesn’t make it
better than other servers (though we think so *j/k*) but it does give
you a wider selection of configurability, which, as you know, is the
best part of setting up a mush. (yea, right)
