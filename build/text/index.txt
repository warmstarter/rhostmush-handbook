RhostMUSH Handbook
******************

The RhostMUSH source tree offers many abilities and options not
normally found in any other flavor of mush.  This doesn’t make it
better than other servers (though we think so *j/k*) but it does give
you a wider selection of configurability, which, as you know, is the
best part of setting up a mush. (yea, right)

================================================

* A high-performance duel-quota system.

* A complete rewrite of key areas and referbishments of all the other
  areas.

* An on-line recover tool for accidental db destruction.

* Multi-wizard architecture for better control of staff.

* Multi-power system to tweek abilities of players.

* Multi-zone system where people can belong to multiple zones.

* Built in error correction for db corruption or other misuse.

* Built in accounting for those annoying twinks who try to hack.
