Methods to block anonymous connections and the pros and cons of doing so
************************************************************************

   Now let’s assume you have some troll attempting to use proxies to
   connect. There’s multiple ways to stop this.


Blacklisting through external tor_pull.sh script
================================================

   In ~/Rhost/Server/game you will see a script called tor_pull.sh
   Execute this by running (from the game directory) ./tor_pull.sh
   This populates the blacklist with registered proxies from various
   sites on the internet.  If you want specified ip’s added, feel free
   to add them at the end of this file.


Blacklisting through internal @blacklist command
================================================

   On the mush, have as part of your startup @blacklist/load This will
   load in the generated blacklist file for automatic forbid sites
   based on the ip.


Blacklisting through internal @tor command
==========================================

   @tor.  Please see ‘wizhelp tor’ on how to set this up.  It in
   effect will actively block all known exit nodes for TOR’s
   annonymous proxy service.  It self-updates and will actively block
   TOR connections.


Blacklisting through internal @admin command
============================================

   @admin proxy_checker (please see wizhelp) This little doodad uses
   MTU checking against packet size which will detect most methods of
   proxies.  Sadly, this also has false positives because some
   situations require a differentating MTU value such as briged
   network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or similar
   encapsulated network services.  However, this option has several
   settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies to
   downright forbidding them.  If you’re being actively attacked, it
   may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection.
