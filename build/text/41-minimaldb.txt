Minimal DB instructions
***********************

The ‘retired’ directory has older image files if you’re interested

Please use the netrhost.conf file with the database as they’re linked.

The flatfile must be loaded in as a new db

This is a minimal db with basic ‘features’ built in.

Copy the txt files into the Rhost’s txt directory off game.
   cp txt/* ~/Rhost/Server/game/txt

mkindx the files (substitute FILENAME with the filename)
   cd ~/Rhost/Server/game/txt ../mkindx FILENAME.txt FILENAME.indx

Steps: 1) Using the Startmush utility for the first time, select the
load db method

— or —

1. copy the netrhost.conf file into the games directory

2. make any relevant changes you wish

3. db_load the flatfile - go into the game directory - type: ./db_load
   data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat
   data/netrhost.db.new

4. Startmush as expected
