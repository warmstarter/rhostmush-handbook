1.1. RhostMUSH Requirements
===========================


1.1.1. System Requirements
--------------------------

* Minimum 1 GB (memory and swap combined) to compile (functions.c is
  huge)

* Any Unix flavor should be fine.  Linux, BSD, Mac OSX, Solaris,
  Tru64, AIX, etc.

* (BETA ONLY) cygwin under Windows.  It requires the entire base
  development set and Requirements below.

* Disk:  100 MB or more (depending on size of db and how many backups
  you wish to maintain)

* Memory: 12-100 MB (depending on size of mush and what size buffers
  you select and packages you include)


1.1.1.1. Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* SunOS (all platforms)

* Solaris (all platforms)

* Linux (all platforms except redhat 5.x mentioned below)

* AIX (all platforms)

* Ultrix (all platforms)

* iBSD (all platforms)

* FreeBSD (all platforms)

* OpenBSD (all platforms)

* NetBSD (all platforms)

* IRIX (all platforms)

* HPUX (32 bit systems only)

If it’s not listed here, it probably still will compile clean.


1.1.1.2. Unsupported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Win32/Win16

* Alpha systems.


1.1.1.3. Untested Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* HP-UX (64 bit systems)

* VMS (all platforms)


1.1.1.4. Known Platform Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Alpha boxes running Redhat 5.0, structure pointers are slaughtered
with the built-in gcc package (up to and including 2.8.x).  Because of
this some config options may not work fully or cause the server to
crash.  This is only a known issue with config options and only on
this platform.


1.1.2. Software Requirements
----------------------------

RhostMUSH is a Linux or Unix based server software that runs as a
daemon on the host. In order to build this software, you will need the
bare minimum of the ability to run ‘make’ commands.

Package requirements are as follows:

* glibc and gcc/clang (compiling the code)

* git (to clone the source and maintain patches)

* bash/ksh/dash (or compatible shell - for use with build menu)

* libcrypt (for password encryption - this is usually standard on unix
  based systems)


1.1.2.1. Optional Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RhostMUSH also offers optional linking and library attachments. For
some of these libraries it will attempt to do auto-detection, but in a
worse case scenario, there exists override hashes in the menu to
disable options it thinks exist that do not.

Optional packages are as follows:

* openssl dev libraries/headers (for MUX password compatibility, and
  digest() and advanced cryptology functionality.

* mysql client & mysql_config (required for mysql capabilities)

* sqlite3 libraries (required for sqlite capabilities)

* ruby/perl/python/etc (for custom interactive dynamic custom
  functions with the execscript() feature)

* libpcre (if you wish to use system pcre libraries instead of the
  built-in ones)


1.1.3. Hosting Requirements
---------------------------

You will need a stable host and access to open a single port number of
your choice on the firewall. Most games choose a number between 1025
and 9999, by convention. Please make sure your debug_id matches the
port number + 5. So if your port is 1234, your debug_id will be 12345.
The debug_id is for use in the API daemon that runs Rhost as a
container to keep track of heap, stack, and execution location.


1.1.4. Requirements if Using Windows
------------------------------------


1.1.4.1. Installing on Windows 10 with BASH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rhost can be compiled and run under the new Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.
This has been tested with the Preview build 14342.

1. After installing Bash you will need to install the following
   packages:

   * gcc

   * git

   * make

   * libpcre3 (optional)

   * libpcre3-dev (optional)

   * openssl (optional)

2. When configuring rhost (using confsource) select the Disable
Debugmon option.

3. When you issue Startmush, you must pass the -cyg option.


1.1.4.2. Installing on Windows with Cygwin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rhost does work under windows using the cygwin package.

1. When you do install cygwin, the following packages must be added:

   * bash

   * crypt

   * gcc

   * gdbm

   * git

   * make

   * openssl (optional)

2. The src/Makefile has to manually have the CYGWIN line uncommented.


1.1.4.3. Startig RhostMUSH on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you issue Startmush, you must pass it the -cyg option.


1.2. Obtaining RhostMUSH
========================

It is assumed that you have gotten to this point with the following
command:

   git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost

If you did NOT get it this way, your file permissions may not be
properly set up.  Please type:

   chmod +rx bin/*.sh src/*.sh game/*.sh game/Startmush game/db_*

This makes sure all the build scripts are properly made executable.
This will result in ‘permission denied’ or similar results when
running a script.


1.3. Compiling RhostMush
========================


1.3.1. Setup directory permissions
----------------------------------

Run the supplied directory permission script:

   ./dirsetup.sh

This is a simple script that will change file permissions and
directory permissions to properly protect RhostMUSH. These settings
generally work fine out of the box so you likely won’t even have to
set this up if you don’t want to.


1.3.2. Compile the source code
------------------------------

Make and run the RhostMUSH source:

   make confsource

If you get an error running the script itself:

   ./bin/script_setup.sh
   make confsource


1.3.2.1. The confsource Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will bring up a menu where you can selection options.

You may also issue ‘make source’ if the Makefile is already defined
how you want it to be.  Please remember to ‘make clean’ before ‘make
source’ whenever you alter the code or import new source code.

After the compile process is done, you should be good to go. If it
complains about missing binaries make sure they are linked:

   make links


1.3.3. Note about Compiling
---------------------------

If your binaries do not work or you get an error type:

   ./bin/script_setup.sh

Then type:

   make confsource

If you are importing a MUX2 flatfile, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that you
select mux passwords as a compatibility option, or you will NOT BE
ABLE to log in to players as the password will not be recognizeable.

Make sure to keep QDBM selected as it’s a much more stable database
engine that does not have attribute limit restrictions like GDBM does.

If you are converting from a Penn, TinyMUSH, or MUX database, make
sure you drill down into the LBUF section and select, at minimum, 8K
lbufs.  You likely want that anyway as it gives you far more room for
attribute content storage.

You can go up to 32K safely.  While 64k is safe and does work, there
are issues with networking and older routers that use a 32K TCP buffer
size that can at times cut off the data as overflow resulting in
output to the end-point players not receiving their data.  So it is
strongly recommended not to go above 32K in lbuffer size.

Go ahead and select 64 char attributes.  It allows you to have 64
characters for attribute names.  It’s handy to have.

If you wish at this point to set up mysql and/or sqlite, you  may do
so. Yes, you can use them in parallel without any issue.


1.3.4. Note about Recompiling
-----------------------------

If you plan to use ‘make confsource’ to recompile your source, you
should first issue a ‘make clean’ before re-issuing a ‘make
confsource’.  ‘make confsource’ remembers the last options you used.

A failure to issue ‘make clean’ prior to re-compiling with ‘make
confsource’ or re-compiling with ‘make source’ can potentially leave
stale object files which may cause unforseen issues when running code,
including but not limited to random crashes.  Generally whenever
recompiling it’s good to always make clean first.


1.4. Installing using an ansible playbook
=========================================

To begin, you will run the following command in a directory that will
house your game:

   git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost

You may also just run the yml file and ansible (ansible-playbook) to
install your RhostMUSH engine:

   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RhostMUSH/trunk/master/rhostinstall.yml
   ansible-playbook rhostinstall.yml

This downloads the latest stable version of the code, bringing with it
all patches and scripts, documentation and support tools that you will
need.


1.5. Starting a Newly Compiled MUSH
===================================


1.5.1. Configuring the game
---------------------------

When setting up a mush for the first time, make sure you have all the
files configured correctly.  This is with using the following file for
configuration:

   - netrhost.conf


1.5.2. Starting the game
------------------------

Once done, you start up the system with the following command:

    - [sh/csh] ./Startmush

   It will prompt you to start a new db if it doesn't find one.

   You may also do the commands individually::

      [csh] netrhost -s netrhost.conf >& netrhost.log &
      [sh]  netrhost -s netrhost.conf > netrhost.log 2>&1 &


1.5.3. First login to the game
------------------------------

Once started, log in the #1 character (Wizard) with it’s appropiate
password (no, not ‘potrzebie’, but ‘Nyctasia’).  There were private
reasons for the password change.

Once in, do a @shutdown to save the database.  Then you can run
Startup normally.   You may make a backup of your database at anytime
on-line by utilizing the @dump/flat option.  A script comes with this
distribution that allows the ability of auto-archiving your database
for a configurable number of backups.


1.6. Creating RHostMUSH with a Provided DB
==========================================


1.6.1. Important before you actually start building
---------------------------------------------------

The main parts of making your RhostMUSH, easy pleasy:

1. The stunnel directory contains TLS/SSL connectivity.  This has to
   be linked to another port and will tunnel to the mush port.  The
   README file explains how to set up and configure your TLS/SSL
   connection.

2. ./patch.sh – This makes sure you have the latest code.  If you got
   this by git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk then you can
   ignore patching.  You can use ./patch.sh at any time to update your
   code.  It ignores local.c incase you make your own modules.

3. make confsource.  Yup, it’s menu driven, nifty eh?

   1. Options you may want to select (other than the defaults):

   2. 5  (%c is selected by default, but choose %x as well for MUX/TM3
      compat)

   3. 9  (if you want $commands to require the COMMAND flag)

   4. 16 (if you want a wider WHO listing like older versions of MUX)

   5. 22 (if you’re converting a TinyMUSH3 or TinyMUX/MUX2 flatfile)

   6. 24 (if you have issues with -lssl not being found)

   7. B3 (for 64 character attribute names)

   8. B6 (select 8K for Penn/MUX2/TM3 default, up to 32K.  64K is
      network intensive)

   9. B5 (will be autoselected if you choose 8K or more.  Pick this
      anyway)

   10. B4 (if you have sqlite libraries and wish to use this)

4. ‘r’ to compile with the settings you selected.

5. Modify your netrhost.conf file as specified.  Make sure to align
   your port and debug_id as shown in the netrhost.conf file.

6. If you wish to port in an old flatfile, please refer to the readme
   directory on how to port your flatfile in (README.DBLOADING).


1.6.2. Using the prebuilt flatfile
----------------------------------

There are pre-loaded flatfile databases you can use at this point.
The netrhost.db.flat and corrisponding netrhost.conf file will be
located in the minimal-DBs/minimal_db directory.

You may auto-load the minimal db and corresponding netrhost.conf file
with the command:

   ./minimal.sh

This is ran from within the ‘game’ directory.  Once this is ran, you
will need to customize the netrhost.conf file for your purposes.  The
port and debug_id must be changed at the very least.  Keep the
debug_id coordinated to the port as described.


1.6.2.1. To load a prebuilt flatfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Make a backup of your existing netrhost.conf file:

      cp game/netrhost.conf game/netrhost.conf.backup

2. Copy the netrhost.conf file into your game directory:

      cp -f ./minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.conf ./game/netrhost.conf

3. At this point you can modify your netrhost.conf file settings in
   your game directory. Using an editor modify the ‘port’ and
   ‘debug_id’ respectively in your netrhost.conf as state. The ‘port’
   will be the port the mush listens on, the debug_id is for the
   debug-stack and is your port with a ‘5’ at the end.  So if your
   port is 4444, the debug_id is 44445

4. Load in the flatfile into the mush (You could do this in the
   Startmush as well) Manually:

      cd game

   ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal-
   DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new dwF

   Start your mush:

      ./Startmush

   This will load the db that you loaded.

   —————OR——-

   From Startmush when prompted, hit <RETURN> for searching then
   select the number of the netrhost.db.flat that is listed as
   ~/minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat:

      ./Startmush


1.7. Almost Backwards Instructions for Compiling and Starting a MUSH
====================================================================

1. You can modify your netrhost.conf file settings in your game
   directory. Using an editor modify the ‘port’ and ‘debug_id’
   respectively in your netrhost.conf as stated. The ‘port’ will be
   the port the mush listens on, the debug_id is for the debug-stack
   and is your port with a ‘5’ at the end.  So if your port is 4444,
   the debug_id is 44445

2. Start your mush:

      --> ./Startmush

You can use the ‘vi’ editor or ‘nano’ if you like a more menu driven
DOS like experience. You can of course use any other editor you’re
familar with.

For a more thorough understanding of how to set things up, keep
reading!

If you have syntax issues running ‘make config’, ‘make confsource’ or
‘make bugreport’ please run the script: ./bin/script_setup.sh

Now… things you may need to do on errors.


1.8. Basic Instructions for starting a new RhostMUSH
====================================================


1.8.1. Manual configuration of source code
------------------------------------------

To do manual configuration (skip if the previous step worked for you)
And yes, this is a bit of a pain in the bottom, hopefully you will not
need this.

You need the following definitions defined to make this work:

1. TINY_U, USE_SIDEEFFECTS, MUX_INCDEC, ATTR_HACK

2. (u()/u2() switched)

3. (sideeffects)

4. (inc()/xinc() switched)

5. (support for _/~ attribs)

You only need to do this if you received the RhostMUSH src.  If you
received a binary, continue on to the next part.

To compile the code, just type ‘make confsource’.  It will prompt you
with settings on what you need to do.  If you just want to quickly
hand edit the Makefile, it is in the directory src (full path
src/Makefile).  Then you may just run ‘make source’, if you so choose
to hand-edit the Makefile.

After the compile process is done, type ‘make links’!


1.8.2. Loading a database for your MUSH
---------------------------------------

You now have a choice of optionally starting at a provided database or
starting from scratch.


1.8.2.1. Option: Only perform these steps if using a provided database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy an existing flatfile and corresponding netrhost.conf file Default
provied example:

   cp game/netrhost.conf game/netrhost.conf.backup
   cp -f minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.conf game/netrhost.conf
   cd game
   ./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm ../minimal-DBs/minimal_db/netrhost.db.flat data/netrhost.db.new


1.8.2.1.1. Configure the netrhost.conf file for your MUSH
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

   Go into the game directory and modify the netrhost.conf file The
   next step is configuring the mush to your config standards. There
   is a file in the game subdirectory called ‘netrhost.conf’. You
   hand-edit this file and just follow what it says each one does.
   It’s very well documented and should give you great details on what
   to edit.  For most things, you can feel comfortable to stick with
   the defaults unless you wish to change them.  The port and debug_id
   need to be changed.


1.9. Start a  MUSH and logging on for the first time
====================================================

From the game diretory issue:

   ./Startmush

To login:

   co Wizard Nyctasia


1.9.1. Option: Things to do once you have connected if you did NOT use a provided database
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. @dig your master room and in your netrhost.conf file define
   master_room to this dbref (without the #.  So like master_room 2)

2. Create an immortal holder charater (@pcreate then @set immortal)
   Feel free to set up holder characters for all the bittypes which
   are: GUILDMASTER, ARCHITECT, COUNCILOR, WIZARD, IMMORTAL

3. @chown/preserve the master room and #0 to the immortal holder
   character.

4. Log into the immortal character

5. @pcreate all your guest characters and set them up properly.  My
   suggestion:

      @dolist lnum(1,10)={@pcreate Guest##=guest;@set *Guest##=guest;@desc *Guest##=A guest player.;@adisconnect *Guest##=home;@lock *Guest##=*Guest##}

      @list guest will show your guest characters and if they're set up properly.

6. Any master room code you load in from your immholder character (or
   @chown/preserve to it) The readme directory has
   softfunctions.minmax that has MUX/Penn compatability functions and
   comsys.  All other softcode (like mail wrappers) can be found on
   https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk in Mushcode.

7. Setup new character, staff, and take tasks that can only be
   accomplished by #1

8. Set up any other characters you want.  Anyone immortal can issue
   @function, @admin, or anything #1 can do.


1.10. Customtize the textfiles for your game
============================================

   All connect.txt and customized files can be found in the
   ~/Server/game/txt directory.  There is a README file there that
   explains their purposes in more detail.  You can see more
   information on all files and how they inter-relate with ‘wizhelp
   file’.


1.11. Three Options for Starting a MUSH
=======================================

The RhostMUSH Git Repository comes with three options for starting
your Mush.


1.11.1. Option 1: Creating a new game with a blank database
-----------------------------------------------------------

   Modify your ./game/netrhost.conf file or what settings you want.
   Don’t feel overwhelmed, it’s all very well documented.


1.11.2. Options 2: Creating a new game with Ambrosia’s default database
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/IMPORTANT_README

The netrhost.conf file you will copy is in minimal-DBs/Amb-
MinimalRhost/game Copy this netrhost.conf file into your ‘game’
directory.

You will want the custom txt files under Amb-MinimalRhost/txt in your
game/txt directory and to mkindx all the txt files.  You can run
./Startmush -i to index.

When ./Startmush prompts you to load a flatfile, say ‘yes’ and hit
<RETURN> to have it search for flatfiles, then select netrhost.db.flat
from under the minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost directory.

The main steps to make sure you do for ~/Server/minimal-DBs/Amb-
MinimalRhost/netrhost.db.flat – Ambrosia’s secure and featured minimal
db

1. Use the matching netrhost.conf file under the Amb-MinimalRhost/game
   directory

2. Load in the settings specified in the Amb-MinimalRhost/bin
   directory.

   1. Copy this file into your ~/Server/bin directory

   2. From ‘Server’ directory type: make clean

   3. From ‘Server’ directory type: make confsource and ‘l’oad option
      0

   4. Specify any -additional- options you want at this point.

   5. Recompile your code

3. Copy the files in Amb-MinimalRhost/game/txt into your
   ~/Server/game/txt directory

4. from your ~/Server/game txt file run on each of the txt files:

      ../mkindx <txtfile>.txt <txtfile>.indx

Note:

  Where <txtfile> is the name of the file (minus the .txt extension)

1. If running, @reboot your game.


1.11.3. Option 3: Creating a new game with the generic default database
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Copy the netrhost.conf from minimal-DBs/minimal_db to your game
   directory.

   When ./Startmush prompts you to load a flatfile, say ‘yes’ and hit
   <RETURN> to have it search for flatfiles, then select
   netrhost.db.flat from under the minimal-DBs/minimal_db directory.


1.12. Starting your MUSH
========================

Once you have used one of these three methods to obtaina database, you
can start your mush up. At this point type from the game directory:

   ./Startmush
