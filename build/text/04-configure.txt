What to type to configure and get your RhostMUSH up and running
***************************************************************

You may configure Rhost three ways.


Creating a new game with a blank database
=========================================

   Modify your ./game/netrhost.conf file or what settings you want.
   Don’t feel overwhelmed, it’s all very well documented.


Creating a new game with Ambrosia’s default database
====================================================

   Follow minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/IMPORTANT_README

   The netrhost.conf file you will copy is in minimal-DBs/Amb-
   MinimalRhost/game Copy this netrhost.conf file into your ‘game’
   directory.

   You will want the custom txt files under Amb-MinimalRhost/txt in
   your game/txt directory and to mkindx all the txt files.  You can
   run ./Startmush -i to index.

   When ./Startmush prompts you to load a flatfile, say ‘yes’ and hit
   <RETURN> to have it search for flatfiles, then select
   netrhost.db.flat from under the minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost
   directory.

   The main steps to make sure you do for Ambrosia’s db: ~/Server
   /minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/netrhost.db.flat – Ambrosia’s secure
   and featured minimal db.

      * Use the matching netrhost.conf file under the Amb-
        MinimalRhost/game directory

      * Load in the settings specified in the Amb-MinimalRhost/bin
        directory. - Copy this file into your ~/Server/bin directory -
        From ‘Server’ directory type: make clean - From ‘Server’
        directory type: make confsource and ‘l’oad option 0 - Specify
        any -additional- options you want at this point. - Recompile
        your code

      * Copy the files in Amb-MinimalRhost/game/txt into your
        ~/Server/game/txt directory

      * from your ~/Server/game txt file run on each of the txt files:
        ../mkindx <txtfile>.txt <txtfile>.indx Where <txtfile> is the
        name of the file (minus the .txt extension)

      * If running, @reboot your game.


Creating a new game with the generic default database
=====================================================

   Copy the netrhost.conf from minimal-DBs/minimal_db to your game
   directory.

   When ./Startmush prompts you to load a flatfile, say ‘yes’ and hit
   <RETURN> to have it search for flatfiles, then select
   netrhost.db.flat from under the minimal-DBs/minimal_db directory.


Starting your MUSH
==================

Once you have used one of these three methods to obtaina database, you
can start your mush up. At this point type from the game directory:

   ./Startmush


Backups for RhostMUSH
=====================

   Backups are already handled and integrated with a script
   ‘backup_flat.sh’. If you wish to customize this, feel free.  Again,
   it is well documented and just require changing settings at the top
   of this script.

   By default, it does 7 contiguous backups.  You may increase or
   decrease this value to any value you want.

   It will, by default, backup all your txt/*.txt files, your
   netrhost.conf file, your netrhost.db.flat (mush db) file, your
   RhostMUSH.dump.* (mail db) files, your RhostMUSH.news.* (internal
   news/bbs db – if used), your RhostMUSH.areg.* (the autoregistration
   db – if used), and any sqlite database you currently may be using
   which are OPTIONALLY backed up if you remove the ‘#’ from before
   it.

   The backup script also will optionally rcp/scp, ftp, or mail any
   backups you want to a remote destination.  Be forewarned, the
   backup files can potentially get rather large for larger games,
   even compressed.  The average size for these files will be 1-5MB.
   It could potentially get over 10-20MB in size for excessively large
   games, so plan accordingly.

   Be aware that the backup system will NOT make successful backups if
   you run out of disk space.  This includes actually running out of
   disk space or running out of disk quota.  There is a mechanism
   inside the backup script to specify an email address that you wish
   to get alerts from in these instances.  I recommend using it.

   If you make changes to your backup_flat.sh script with an already
   active and running mush and wish to just restart the backup
   procedure just issue: ./backup_restart.sh


Troubleshooting issues with starting up
=======================================

If you run into issues:
   Probelm: If it says the shared ID is already in use
      A1: please verify that it is the right shared debug_id in your
         netrhost.conf file

      A2: Force a start by ./Startmush -f

   Problem: Your log file is massive and your mush is running
      A1: To rotate this use the @logrotate command.
         See wizhelp on @logrotate

   Problem: The database flatfile you’re loading can’t load because
         a db is already defined.

      A1: remove netrhost.db* and netrhost.gdbm* from your data
      directory

   Problem: The mail database won’t load and mail shows ‘offline’
      A1: wmail/load
