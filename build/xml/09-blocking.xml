            <paragraph>Now let’s assume you have some troll attempting to use proxies to connect.
                There’s multiple ways to stop this.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>In ~/Rhost/Server/game you will see a script called tor_pull.sh
                    Execute this by running (from the game directory) ./tor_pull.sh
                    This populates the blacklist with registered proxies from various sites
                    on the internet.  If you want specified ip’s added, feel free to add
                    them at the end of this file.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>On the mush, have as part of your startup @blacklist/load
                    This will load in the generated blacklist file for automatic forbid
                    sites based on the ip.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>@tor.  Please see ‘wizhelp tor’ on how to set this up.  It in effect
                    will actively block all known exit nodes for TOR’s annonymous proxy
                    service.  It self-updates and will actively block TOR connections.</paragraph>

                    This little doodad uses MTU checking against packet size which will
                    detect most methods of proxies.  Sadly, this also has false positives
                    because some situations require a differentating MTU value such as
                    briged network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or
                    similar encapsulated network services.  However, this option has
                    several settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies
                    to downright forbidding them.  If you’re being actively attacked,
                    it may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection.</paragraph>
