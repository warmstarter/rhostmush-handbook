                <paragraph>On Alpha boxes running Redhat 5.0, structure pointers are slaughtered with
                    the built-in gcc package (up to and including 2.8.x).  Because of this some
                    config options may not work fully or cause the server to crash.  This is only
                    a known issue with config options and only on this platform.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>RhostMUSH is a Linux or Unix based server software that runs as a daemon on the host.  In order to build this software, you will need the bare minimum of the ability to run ‘make’ commands.  Package requirements are as follows:
                * glibc and gcc/clang (compiling the code)
                * git (to clone the source and maintain patches)
                * bash/ksh/dash (or compatible shell - for use with build menu)
                * libcrypt (for password encryption - this is usually standard on unix based systems)</paragraph>

                <title>Optional Packages</title>
                <paragraph>RhostMUSH also offers optional linking and library attachments.  For some of these libraries it will attempt to do auto-detection, but in a worse case scenario, there exists override hashes in the menu to disable options it thinks exist that do not.  Optional packages are as follows:
                    * openssl dev libraries/headers (for MUX password compatibility, and digest() and advanced cryptology functionality.
                    * mysql client &amp; mysql_config (required for mysql capabilities)
                    * sqlite3 libraries (required for sqlite capabilities)
                    * ruby/perl/python/etc (for custom interactive dynamic custom functions with the execscript() feature)
                    * libpcre (if you wish to use system pcre libraries instead of the built-in ones)</paragraph>

            <paragraph>You will need a stable host and access to open a single port number of your choice on the firewall.  Most games choose a number between 1025 and 9999, by convention.  Please make sure your debug_id matches the port number + 5.  So if your port is 1234, your debug_id will be 12345.  The debug_id is for use in the API daemon that runs Rhost as a container to keep track of heap, stack, and execution location.</paragraph>
