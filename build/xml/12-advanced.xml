                        <paragraph>Debugging in Rhost allows for advanced features like expressing where and
                            when to do debugging via a trace() function, with toggled labels, and the
                            ability to grep content from trace output.  There also exists features to
                            color-match parenthesis, braces, and brackets in-game as well as pretty print
                            the output of commands and functions.

                        <paragraph>Functions and commands can both be overridden with softcode.  To
                            override a hardcoded command you first set the command ignore.
                            There are various levels of ignoring so that you could have it
                            ignored from mortals but have it executed fine for non-mortals.
                            This allows you to use the actual physical command within a
                            softcode override.  You may also use @Hook for altering how
                            a command works.   Functions are overridden by setting the
                            function in question ignored, then writing a softcode alternative
                            that is then executed and fetched appropriately.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Rhost has a recycle bin that works a bit like a windows recycle bin.
                            Whenever you destroy something within the mush, it is stacked onto
                            the recycle bin and marked unavailable within the mush.  This marks
                            the dbref# as garbage in any sense of the word.  However, the object
                            is not able to be reused until purged.  Once purged, it is put onto
                            a free list that can then be reassigned to a new object.

                        <paragraph>This is something that should be discussed by you and the staff
                            of your game.  As a good rule of thumb, only provide the bitlevel
                            that is required to do the job.  Too much power is always risky.
                            In essence, each tier of bit can do everything the previous bitlevel
                            can do, and then additional stuff on top of it.  The highest bitlevel
                            is #1 itself, being bitlevel 7.  Then immortal, which should be
                            considered the #1 character in most cases and is bitlevel 6.  Then
                            the royalty character, which is equal to wizard on penn, mux, or
                            other codebases.  For most things, this is the bitlevel you want
                            to assign players.  The exception will likely be game owners or
                            people who control the master room code.</paragraph>

                            attribute set on any object in that cluster can be set or fetched
                            as if it was a singular entity.  This allows some amazing ability

                            amount of attributes without paying a hefty penalty on object bloat.</paragraph>
