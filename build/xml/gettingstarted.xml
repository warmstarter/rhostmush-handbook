                <title>Bitlevels</title>
                <paragraph>The whole DB is highly geared for a low-bitlevel setup.
                    I am a strong believer in least-privileges-needed to do the job. Bittypes and
                    powers are tools to do that job, not badges of friendship or trust that get
                    tossed about.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Here is my suggested list of powers and bittypes for staffers:</paragraph>

                                a player should belong to a BC-Houston-Powered that is @powered
                                EXAMINE_ALL, LONG_FINGERS And TEL_ANYTHING on Guildmaster level.
                                If the object actually needs to modify a player directly, have
                                it use a restricted staff Global, or if you absolutely must,
                                make a BC-Houston-Admin and @set it Architect. Do not give
                                normal builders access to it, only @chown things to it and @set
                                them inherit after review.
                                Both the -powered and -admin BCs can have random passwords and
                                be @set NO_CONNECT.</paragraph>

                                latter technically allows them to @chown anything guildmaster-
                                and lower-owned in the master and auxiliary rooms. However,
                                it allows the Building Head to @chown items between BCs- and
                                to the BC-&lt;location&gt;-powered.</paragraph>

                        bc-admin-councilor.
                        If you as the MU* Head(s) don’t know Softcode well, or want to
                        leave anything Code to your Head Coder, also give them optional
                        access to a maintenance Royalty bit in order to properly code
                        banning/blacklisting +commands and other rare code that requires
                        Royalty powers. Again, chown finished code to bc-admin-royalty.</paragraph>

                                Depending on actual involvement with your game, their abilities
                                in-game can range from merely being @powered free_wall for
                                notifying players of downtimes and/or being @powered shutdown in
                                order to shut down the game for maintenance, up to being the
                                only person with actual access to #1.</paragraph>

                <section ids="globals" names="globals">
                    <title>Globals</title>
                    <paragraph>Handle necessary functionality for adminning through the admin-only globals and
                        softcode.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The setup I personally suggest is to have ALL staffers be AT MAX Architect-level
                        for everyday work and communication, with special coders that -really- require
                        it having Councilor-characters available to log into for maintenance or special
                        code setup. Technically if everything is done right, the Coder(s) of the game do
                        not require higher privileges than Architect for the vast majority of things.
                        Royalty-level code should be a rare exception, if at all necessary. The MU*
                        Head(s) or site-admin should be the only one having access to #1, Immortals or
                        perhaps even Royalty. The BC’s, Global Function objects and Function objects at
                        level Royalty and higher have simply been provided as a if-necessary convenience.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Current objects are only @chowned to certain bitlevels if it is really required
                        for them to function. Whenever possible, they have been @chowned to the mortal
                        BC-Admin-Mortal. All custom global functions listed above are on the semi-
                        -mortal Global Functions object. The Master Room and Auxiliary Room have been
                        @chowned to BC-Admin-Architect.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The Comsystem and +bboard are owned by BC-Admin-Architect, which means that
                        higher bitlevels might not be able to use those systems if they hide and set
                        themselves DARK. This is intentional. The Architect bitlevel is enough to freely
                        set attributes on players, so these systems did not need anything higher, and
                        it prioritizes Councilor+ as mere mainenance-duty bitlevels. Even the MU* Head
                        should log on as an Architect for everyday things.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The Comsystem and BBOARD have been modified to be configurable by Architect and
                        higher. Both systems have a CANUSE attribute with the according code on them.
                        Note that if you want both systems to be only configurable by Councilor+, that
                        instead of @chowning them to a Councilor after changing those attribute for
                        Councilor or higher, I suggest to simply @set the bboard and comsystem core
                        objects NO_MODIFY instead, keeping them at Architect-power but making them
                        unmodifyable by Architects.</paragraph>

                    <title>Quota</title>
                    <paragraph>I highly recommend the use of the alternative @quota system. BC-Admin-Mortal
                        and BC-Admin-Guildmaster both have this @quota system set up on themselves. Both
                        of them have a high amount of money for everyday operations. You should not give
                        them free quota or money.</paragraph>

                <section dupnames="functions" ids="id15">
                    <title>Functions</title>
                    <paragraph>I also recommend to setup most global functions with /Privileged even if they
                        are mortal-powered, to make them work even when players are set NO_CODE and
                        WANDERER by default.</paragraph>
