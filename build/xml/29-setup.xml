        <title>Additional simplified notes on setting up RhostMUSH</title>
        <paragraph>This is the readme file for RhostMUSH.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The RhostMUSH source tree offers many abilities and options
            not normally found in any other flavor of mush.  This doesn’t
            make it better than other servers (though we think so <emphasis>j/k</emphasis>)
            but it does give you a wider selection of configurability,
            which, as you know, is the best part of setting up a mush.
            (yea, right)</paragraph>
