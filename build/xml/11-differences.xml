        <title>The differences to expect to the end user between PennMUSH, MUX, and RhostMUSH as of 08/06/2016</title>
        <paragraph>The largest end user experience will mostly resolve around some look and feel.
            The general look and feel of how to set attributes, work with commands and
            functions, and getting around a grid will be identical between the mush flavors.
            @nuke and @destroy will work somewhat differently between the three codebases
            and some effort should be looked at on how different it behaves.</paragraph>
