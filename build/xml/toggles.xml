        <title>What FLAGS, TOGGLES, POWERS, and DEPOWERS mean in RhostMUSH</title>

            <title>What are Flags?</title>
            <paragraph>Flags are pretty much exactly the same as any other mush.  It's a flag
                that you set or unset on a target which then enables/disables or
                alters something that target can do.  There's help on all the flags
                in help and wizhelp.</paragraph>
        </section>
        <section ids="what-are-toggles" names="what\ are\ toggles?">
            <title>What are Toggles?</title>
            <paragraph>Toggles were designed as a single point flag that immediately enables
                or disables a set ability or condition, thus a 'toggle'.  It works
                exactly like a flag and was originally designed for two reasons.  To
                distinguish from the multi-meaning of a 'flag', and because frankly
                we ran out of flag space :)</paragraph>

        <section ids="what-is-an-power" names="what\ is\ an\ @power?">
            <title>What is an @power?</title>
            <paragraph>A power is similar to a power on other mushes, but unlike them, our
                powers are multi-tier.  This means that they can be customized to
                empower something at a given bitlevel.  You may empower something
                from guildmaster up to councilor level.  There are some powers
                with a power level of N/A meaning they are a toggle power granting
                an absolute power level as specified in the help for that power.
                This requires the INHERIT flag for non-players to inherit powers,
                however, a specific object can be granted a power as well.</paragraph>
        </section>
        <section ids="what-is-an-depower" names="what\ is\ an\ @depower?">
            <title>What is an @depower?</title>
            <paragraph>This is the anti-thesis of @power.  Also, depowers do not require
                inheritance.  They also have priority over flags, toggles, and
                powers.  You can use depower to remove or lower abilities and
                control from a target, even a full wizard (royalty) can be
                depowered.</paragraph>
