        <title>Network Port redirector</title>
        <paragraph>This is a port redirector incase you decide to move your mush
            to a new site/port.  To use, first, compile the code.  To do
            this you would type the following:</paragraph>
        <block_quote>
            <paragraph>cc portmsg.c -o portmsg</paragraph>
        </block_quote>
        <paragraph>if ‘cc’ is not defined, try the following:</paragraph>
        <block_quote>
            <paragraph>gcc portmsg.c -o portmsg</paragraph>
        </block_quote>
        <paragraph>Once compiled, you would then modify the file ‘file’ to describe
            the mush, what was done, where it’s moved to, then specify the
            IP address and the PORT where specified.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>To launch the application, you would then type:</paragraph>
        <block_quote>
            <paragraph>./portmsg file &lt;port&gt;</paragraph>
        </block_quote>
        <paragraph>Where &lt;port&gt; is the port where the mush used to run at.</paragraph>
