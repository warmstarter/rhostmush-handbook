            <title>Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH</title>
            <paragraph>In the ~/Server/convert directory there is a script called ‘doconvert.sh’</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This script will convert most flatfiles from existing mush engines to
                RhostMUSH.  The exception is PennMUSH 1.8.0 and later.  For this there is a
                BETA converter penn18x_converter.tgz.  This is proven to work, most of the time,
                with codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not been fully vetted with
                the latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To convert a non-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you first
                need a valid flatfile of the game you’re wanting to convert.  Please refer
                to the documentatation of the mush engine in question (MUX, Penn 1.7, TM2/3)
                on how to do this.  Once you have it type:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>./doconvert.sh FLATFILETOCONVERT FLATFILEOUTPUT</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In this instance, FLATFILETOCONVERT will be the filename (with full path) to
                the flatfile you are wishing to convert.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The FLATFILEOUTPUT is anyfilename you wish to name the RhostMUSH converted
                flatfile.  I suggest netrhost_converted.db.flat so you know by the name
                what it is.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Follow what it asks for and just let it do its thing.</paragraph>
