            <title>Considerations to locking down restrictions in RhostMUSH</title>
            <paragraph>Sometimes, you want to have things run at various privilage levels and do not
                want to have things with too much access.  Weither that is online objects or
                players you want to block from connecting to your mush.  Here’s things you can
                do.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>One thing to keep in mind is that RhostMUSH, unlike PennMUSH is not flag
                dependant on permission level, it’s ownership based.  While setting a wizard
                flag on an object would work, it’s not recommended and it is instead recommended
                to chown the object in question to a wizard (like your wizard holder character)
                Then the object must be set inherit to actually inherit the wizard.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>We have various flag levels.  It is strongly recommanded you check wizhelp
                    on ‘control’ for a detailed overview of what each bitlevel can or can not do
                    prior to giving the ownership to the object.  Things useful for tweaking control
                    on players and objects:</paragraph>

                when you decide to use some of the advanced features of RhostMUSH.

                        @admin attr_access – used for built in attributes (like desc)

                    <paragraph>@icmd    - Very useful.   Please see wizhelp on it.  It disallows commands from executing including overriding them with softcode alternatives
                        @admin access - Changes permissions, disables, or sets to be overridden a command.  Useful when you plan to override commands with softcode.</paragraph>

                <block_quote>
                    <paragraph>GUEST    - This is your guest flag, it should only be set on guests
                        WANDERER - the WANDERER flag is default on new players.  This flag disables all building abilitites of the player.
                        NO_COMMAND - You can use this to stop a player from being able to connect without worrying about changing their password
                        FUBAR      - As the flag states, it f*’s them up beind all recognition.  It essentially stops them from doing absolutely anything in the mush but pose and say.  Yes, it even disables the quit command.
                        SLAVE      - Funny enough, slave allows anything but say and pose.  To ruin a troll’s life, set both FUBAR and SLAVE and sit back and smile.
                        NO_TEL     - The target can’t teleport or be teleported
                        NO_MOVE    - The target is locked at their location unable to move at all
                        NO_WALL    - They do not see any @wall except a wizard @wall/no_prefix.  This has the bonus of snuffing db save messages.
                        NO_POSSESS - Sometimes it’s useful to grant a builder character to multiple players.  The NO_POSSESS flag makes it so that player can not be logged in more than 2 times.
                        NO_MODIFY  - The target can not be modified (except by immortal/#1)
                        NO_EXAMINE - The target can not be examined/decompiled (except by immortal/#1)
                        STOP       - Once a matching $command is found on an object set STOP, it ‘stops’ trying to find other $command matches.
                        NOSTOP     - If a target that is set STOP is also set NOSTOP, it will check the master room for a command and execute that as well if found.
                        NO_PESTER  - Stops target from @pemit or whisper.  You may use @icmd as well.
                        NO_OVERRIDE - Useful for immortals.  By default they override all locks, including attribute locks.  This makes it so an immortal’s passing of locks will behave like a mortals NO_USELOCK  - This is like NO_OVERRIDE but only effects uselocks.  You likely want to set this on your immortal and wizard.
                        NO_ANSINAME - stops a target from having an ansified name
                        NO_CODE     - lock down advanced coding from a target
                        SPAMMONITOR - stop a target from issuing more than 60 commands a minute.
                        FREE        - Stop costing money for day to day processing of commands/building</paragraph>

                        This little doodad uses MTU checking against packet size which will
                        detect most methods of proxies.  Sadly, this also has false positives
                        because some situations require a differentating MTU value such as
                        briged network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or
                        similar encapsulated network services.  However, this option has
                        several settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies
                        to downright forbidding them.  If you’re being actively attacked,
                        it may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection.</paragraph>

                        not set will default to ‘localhost 127.0.0.1’.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>sconnect_reip 1         – This enables the SSL tunnel layer handler within rhost.
                        sconnect_cmd XYZZY      – this will set the secret SSL command handshake command to XYZZY.  This is case sensitive and can be up to 31 characters.  Please make sure to only use printable non-whitespace characters.  Ergo: one word
                        sconnect_host wildcards – This allows wildcarded sites (one or more) to allow to access the sconnect/stunnel handler.  This defaults to ‘localhost’ and ‘127.0.0.1’ so if you have ‘localhost.localdomain’ instead then you must set this to whatever is seen as ‘localhost’ to you.  You can verify this by checking your /etc/hosts file.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Note: the sconnect_host is optional.  If you do not specify it, it will default to two values:  ‘localhost’ and ‘127.0.0.1’.</paragraph>

                        It will prompt you with whatever you set for your mush name.  If you have not
                        selected a mush name at this point, you can select the defaults.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>You will want to use the config file for warpbubble as this hides the secret.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Be aware that if you have DNS host lookups disabled on your mush, you
                        MUST have 127.0.0.1 as an entry for your sconnect_host file.</paragraph>
