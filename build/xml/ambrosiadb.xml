                softcode.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The setup I personally suggest is to have ALL staffers be AT MAX Architect-level
                for everyday work and communication, with special coders that -really- require
                it having Councilor-characters available to log into for maintenance or special
                code setup. Technically if everything is done right, the Coder(s) of the game do
                not require higher privileges than Architect for the vast majority of things.
                Royalty-level code should be a rare exception, if at all necessary. The MU*
                Head(s) or site-admin should be the only one having access to #1, Immortals or
                perhaps even Royalty. The BC’s, Global Function objects and Function objects at
                level Royalty and higher have simply been provided as a if-necessary convenience.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Current objects are only @chowned to certain bitlevels if it is really required
                for them to function. Whenever possible, they have been @chowned to the mortal
                BC-Admin-Mortal. All custom global functions listed above are on the semi-
                -mortal Global Functions object. The Master Room and Auxiliary Room have been
                @chowned to BC-Admin-Architect.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Comsystem and +bboard are owned by BC-Admin-Architect, which means that
                higher bitlevels might not be able to use those systems if they hide and set
                themselves DARK. This is intentional. The Architect bitlevel is enough to freely
                set attributes on players, so these systems did not need anything higher, and
                it prioritizes Councilor+ as mere mainenance-duty bitlevels. Even the MU* Head
                should log on as an Architect for everyday things.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Comsystem and BBOARD have been modified to be configurable by Architect and
                higher. Both systems have a CANUSE attribute with the according code on them.
                Note that if you want both systems to be only configurable by Councilor+, that
                instead of @chowning them to a Councilor after changing those attribute for
                Councilor or higher, I suggest to simply @set the bboard and comsystem core
                objects NO_MODIFY instead, keeping them at Architect-power but making them
                unmodifyable by Architects.</paragraph>

                of them have a high amount of money for everyday operations. You should not give
