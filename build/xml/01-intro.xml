        <title>What RhostMUSH is about and what’s so great about RhostMUSH.</title>
        <paragraph>RhostMUSH was founded in 1989, originally by Natasha Davis (Nyctasia) and as
            a branch from the original release of TinyMUD code.  It was her desire to make
            a game that was flexible, with multiple levels of progression and highly
            customizeable.  She lost time and interest and passed the game to
            Steve Shivers (Seawolf), Mike McDermott (Thorin), and Jace Hoppel (Ashen-Shugar)</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Through their work, the stability improved, we fixed it to be multi-platform
            and as bug free as we could possibly make it.  We introduced several methods both
            in game and in source that allowed consistent memory bounds checking and
            various alerts for any mischievous naughtyness in-game or possibilities of any
            hacks, patches, or alterations in the code causing leaks or issues.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While not perfect, it has allowed us to have an absolutely outstanding
            turn around for any bugs sent our way, which anyone who uses RhostMUSH will
            attest to.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Over the years, others have joined the RhostMUSH team, including Ambrosia
            (who is the current dev lead), Lensman, Kage (who kindly provided the
            UTF8/unicode port), Jeff/Loki, Rook, Noltar, and Odin.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We also have had hundreds of people who have offered (and provided) help,
            patches, suggestions, bug fixes, and alternations all on their own and
            every single one will have had their name mentioned in the RHOST.CHANGES
            file in the readme directory.  It’s far too large to have in the online
            help files.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>RhostMUSH today provides an amazing tool that allows nearly entire
            customization in-game of every single feature available in Rhost without
            having the requirement to modify the hardcode.  This includes but is
            not limited to:</paragraph>

            <title>Recycle bin</title>
            <block_quote>
                <paragraph>Yup, you guessed it.  RhostMUSH has a windows like recycle bin.
                    This means the objects you @nuke and @destroy become ‘destroyed’
                    but not recycled until they are @purged.  If you use the Myrddin
                    CRON in the Mushcode directory, it by default sets up a job
                    to purge anything over 30 days old, which should be more than
                    sufficient for any needs.  The goodness of this?  You can recover
                    nuked things from any period of time, as long as they were not
                    @purged first.
                    Commands: @purge, @nuke, @destroy, @recover, @reclist</paragraph>

                    It essentially does a flatfile dump of a dbref#.  Great for
                    backups or cross-Rhost portability.

            <paragraph>The flexibility to customize RhostMUSH is what is most daunting.
                Don’t fret, you don’t need to do it to run RhostMUSH successfully.
                In fact, the default configuration is mostly compatible with
                MUSH and will work correctly out of the box for most needs.  For those
                wishing to play, of course the sky is the limit of what you want to
                do.</paragraph>
