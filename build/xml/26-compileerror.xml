            <title>Changes to conf for high-bit CPUs</title>
            <paragraph>RhostMUSH automatically detects 64-bit platforms, and should compile
                cleanly on these.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In case you are trying to compile Rhost on some other crazy-wide CPUs
                such as the PS2, PS3 or other 128 or 256 bit CPUs, you can easily do
                so by changing a few lines of code in conf.c.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>change:
                typedef unsigned int    pmath1;
                typedef int             pmath2;
                #define ALLIGN1 4</paragraph>
            <paragraph>to:
                typedef unsigned long   pmath1;
                typedef long            pmath2;
                #define ALLIGN1 8</paragraph>
            <paragraph>, replacing 8 with the size of your CPU’s long integer. (4 for 32-bit,
                8 for 64-bit, 16 for 128-bit, etc etc)</paragraph>
            <paragraph>RhostMUSH has only been tested to work on the AMD64, but there is no
                reason to believe the same will not hold true for IA64.</paragraph>

        <section ids="changes-to-autconf-for-certain-systems" names="changes\ to\ autconf\ for\ certain\ systems">
            <title>Changes to autconf for certain systems</title>
            <paragraph>You should not have to worry about this, but incase something really
                weird occurs, you may need to look into these changes…</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The autoconfig.h file needs to have modifications to it by hand.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There are three manual entries:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This one sets how it defines the int to character pointer.  It’s safe
                to keep it as ‘unsigned int’ for 32 bit platforms.  For non 32-bit,
                define it to  how an int is defined on that system.</paragraph>
            <block_quote>
                <paragraph>typedef unsigned int    pmath1;</paragraph>
            </block_quote>
            <paragraph>This one sets how it defines the signed int to character pointer.  Same
                restrictions apply as above for unsigned int.</paragraph>
            <block_quote>
                <paragraph>typedef int     pmath2;</paragraph>
            </block_quote>
            <paragraph>This sets the allignment for the given platform.  4 represents a 32 bit
                platform.  8 would represent a 64 bit platform, etc.  Change accordingly.</paragraph>
            <block_quote>
                <paragraph>#define ALLIGN1 4</paragraph>
            </block_quote>
            <paragraph>Make sure these three entries are defined in your autoconf.h file else
                the mush will not compile.</paragraph>
