            <paragraph>Yes, that’s all you have to do.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>You may also issue ‘make source’ if the Makefile is already defined how
                you want it to be.  Please remember to ‘make clean’ before ‘make source’
                whenever you alter the code or import new source code.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>To install, type:  make confsource</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If your binaries do not work or you get an error type:  ./bin/script_setup.sh
                    Then type: make confsource</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If you are importing a MUX2 flatfile, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that you select
                    mux passwords as a compatibility option, or you will NOT BE ABLE to log in
                    to players as the password will not be recognizeable.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Make sure to keep QDBM selected as it’s a much more stable database engine
                    that does not have attribute limit restrictions like GDBM does.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If you are converting from a Penn, TinyMUSH, or MUX database, make sure you
                    drill down into the LBUF section and select, at minimum, 8K lbufs.  You likely
                    want that anyway as it gives you far more room for attribute content storage.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>You can go up to 32K safely.  While 64k is safe and does work, there are issues
                    with networking and older routers that use a 32K TCP buffer size that can
                    at times cut off the data as overflow resulting in output to the end-point
                    players not receiving their data.  So it is strongly recommended not to go
                    above 32K in lbuffer size.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Go ahead and select 64 char attributes.  It allows you to have 64 characters
                    for attribute names.  It’s handy to have.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If you wish at this point to set up mysql and/or sqlite, you  may do so.
                    Yes, you can use them in parallel without any issue.</paragraph>

                <title>Note about Recompiling</title>
                <paragraph>If you plan to use ‘make confsource’ to recompile your source, you should first
                    issue a ‘make clean’ before re-issuing a ‘make confsource’.  ‘make confsource’
                    remembers the last options you used.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>A failure to issue ‘make clean’ prior to re-compiling with ‘make confsource’ or
                    re-compiling with ‘make source’ can potentially leave stale object files which
                    may cause unforseen issues when running code, including but not limited to
                    random crashes.  Generally whenever recompiling it’s good to always make clean
                    first.</paragraph>

                <title>Note about Patching</title>
                <paragraph>There’s two ways you can look to patch the source.  If you plan to run the
                    RhostMUSH source from a git repository, then please use the git repo to
                    constantly update your code.  If you knew enough to want to set up a git repo
                    then we expect knowledge on how to keep source trees updated in the git repo
                    to be used the same as any other source distribution.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If, however, you have no idea what a git repo even is, or have no inclination
                    of using git to manage your RhostMUSH source, or just don’t care one way
                    or another, then you can use the included patch.sh routine (from under the
                    Server directory) to patch your source at any time.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>From the server directory just type: ./patch.sh</paragraph>
                <paragraph>That will auto-compile your source, auto make all your header files and
                    essentially keep everything up to date to the latest source.
                    Once that’s done, all you do from within the game is two commands:</paragraph>

                        paranoia is fine, especially when they really are out to get you.  TO make the backups, do the following:</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>@dump/flat      – This makes a flatfile dump of the main database.  You want to run this daily.
                        wmail/unload    – This makes a flatfile dump of the mail database.  You want to run this daily.
                        @areg/unload    – Only worry about this if you are using auto-registration emailing.  Few do.
                        newsdb/unload   – Only worry if you use the hardcoded bbs system.  Most don’t use it.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The backup_flat.sh script (that launches automatically with Startmush) will archive all the above files
                        if they exist.  It moves these flatfiles into the ‘prevflat’ directory, then tarballs those and dumps
                        consecutive backups in the ‘oldflat’ directory.  By default it keeps 7 consecutive backups.  You may
                        alter this in the backup_flat.sh script itself.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>The netrhost.conf file you will copy is in minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/game

                    <paragraph>You will want the custom txt files under Amb-MinimalRhost/txt in your game/txt
                        directory and to mkindx all the txt files.  You can run ./Startmush -i to index.</paragraph>

                <title>Backups for RhostMUSH</title>
                <block_quote>
                    <paragraph>Backups are already handled and integrated with a script ‘backup_flat.sh’.
                        If you wish to customize this, feel free.  Again, it is well documented and
                        just require changing settings at the top of this script.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>By default, it does 7 contiguous backups.  You may increase or decrease
                        this value to any value you want.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>It will, by default, backup all your txt/<emphasis>.txt files, your netrhost.conf
                            file, your netrhost.db.flat (mush db) file, your RhostMUSH.dump.</emphasis>
                        (mail db) files, your RhostMUSH.news.* (internal news/bbs db – if used),
                        your RhostMUSH.areg.* (the autoregistration db – if used), and any sqlite
                        database you currently may be using which are OPTIONALLY backed up if you
                        remove the ‘#’ from before it.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The backup script also will optionally rcp/scp, ftp, or mail any backups
                        you want to a remote destination.  Be forewarned, the backup files can
                        potentially get rather large for larger games, even compressed.  The
                        average size for these files will be 1-5MB.  It could potentially get
                        over 10-20MB in size for excessively large games, so plan accordingly.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Be aware that the backup system will NOT make successful backups if you
                        run out of disk space.  This includes actually running out of disk space
                        or running out of disk quota.  There is a mechanism inside the backup
                        script to specify an email address that you wish to get alerts from
                        in these instances.  I recommend using it.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>If you make changes to your backup_flat.sh script with an already
                        active and running mush and wish to just restart the backup procedure
                        just issue: ./backup_restart.sh</paragraph>
