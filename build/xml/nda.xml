        <title>Historical Non-Disclosure Agreement</title>
        <paragraph>The following NDA comes from the time when RhostMUSH was not publially
            available. It is preserved here for historical reasons. We are suckers for
            looking back at things. :)

                                    it (with full credits to you), but we belive once you have the code,
                                    you should be allowed to play with it fully as long as the first two
                                    rules are kept.
