        <paragraph>The following NDA comes from the time when RhostMUSH was not publially
            available. It is preserved here for historical reasons. We are suckers for
            looking back at things. :)

            <paragraph>The Rhost developers would like to see what was added, and possibly
                look at adding them to the main distro if we see others would like
                it (with full credits to you), but we belive once you have the code,
                you should be allowed to play with it fully as long as the first two
                rules are kept.</paragraph>
