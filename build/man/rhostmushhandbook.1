The RhostMUSH source tree offers many abilities and options
not normally found in any other flavor of mush.  This doesn\(aqt
make it better than other servers (though we think so \fIj/k\fP)
but it does give you a wider selection of configurability,
which, as you know, is the best part of setting up a mush.
(yea, right)

.SH INSTALLING RHOSTMUSH
.SS Obtaining RhostMUSH Source Code
.sp
The only official source for obtaining RhostMUSH is through the \(aqRhostMUSH\(aq
github account. If the source code was obtained in some other manner, there
are potentially any number of unintentional or intentional issues that you
might run into.
.sp
The recommended method of obtaing RhostMUSH is to clone it\(aqs git reposistory:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is possible, but not recommended to download RhostMUSH via a web browser:
.INDENT 0.0

.INDENT 3.5
This documentation generally assumes that you obtained the RhostMUSH source
code by cloning it\(aqs git repository or at the very least downloading an
archive of the source code from the GitHub website.
.sp
It also assumes that the base directory from which all commands are run
and all files are looked for is that git repo\(aqs \fBServer/\fP directory,
unless specifically noted otherwise.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Options for making a MUSH
.sp
There is a \fIlot\fP of options once your start making your MUSH, but there are
also a few big choices right as you get started making a MUSH. No matter which
choices you ultimately make, there are certain things you will need to know how
to do. This chapter is going to walk you through making the simplest possible
version of RhostMUSH. It\(aqs going to show you the things you would have to do
no matter which choices you were making.
.sp
In the process of making that simplest possible RhostMUSH you\(aqll also learn
what the basics of those choices are and when and how you would make them.
Later chapters will get much more into all of those choices, but they will also
assume you know everything in this chapter already, or at least have it as a
handy point of reference.
.sp
While there are lots of little options, there are three big areas where you
make those choices.
.SS Compile time options
.sp
One of the first steps of making a MUSH or really any computer program is
to compile the source code. This takes what\(aqs basically text files full of code
and turns them into a program you can run. Within that source code are a
number of options to choose from, but any time you want to change one of them,
you have to recompile the source code and then restart the MUSH.
.sp
These choices are typically made through the \fBconfsource\fP menu which you\(aqll
be seeing momentarily. There are some pretty big choices here from whether or
not you want hardcoded +help and comsys, deciding between a more secure server
and certtain powerful but potentially dangerous MUSHcode options, and then
whether or not you want to be able to connect to a variety of external programs
like databases, webservers, and even other programming languages.
.SS Configuration file options
.sp
While there are some options in RhostMUSH that can only be changed through
recompiling the source code, there are way more options that can be changed
without having to recompile. These choices are mostly made through the
\fBnetrhost.conf\fP file. Whenever a MUSH starts up or gets rebooted, it\(aqs
going to look to what\(aqs in that file. A few of those choices relate to
further configuring the choices you made with \fBconfsource\fP
.sp
The \fBnetrhost.conf\fP file has some aesthetic options like what if anything
it says when the database is being saved or whether or not your MUSH will
allow ANSI color, both in general, but also in things like people\(aqs names.
It has a lot of very esoteric options for tuning the performance and safety
of your MUSH. It also is where you define things that connect to your database
like your master room and guests. It let\(aqs you determine which powers your
staff does or does not have, and it\(aqs also where you have an option to change
the password for #1 should you forget it. There are ways to change some of
these options from within the MUSH and even have those changes become new
defaults that survive a reboot. One thing you set there that you definitely
can\(aqt change from within the MUSH, is which port it runs on.
.SS Starting database options
.sp
This last big choice is one that you probably are well aware of at least some
of the things it allows for, mostly because the database is basically where
everyone on a MUSH lives. Most of the choices you ever make about your MUSH
will happen in the database and it\(aqs something that\(aqs basically always going
to be changing in more ways than any one person could follow. No matter how
vast the database of a MUSH gets, they all started somewhere, and that\(aqs the
last big choice you have to make.
.sp
Depending on how you look at it, there\(aqs somewhere between thousands of choices
and two choices for a starting database. What I mean is that you have the
choice of starting with a brand new database to populate, only a room (#0) and
you (#1), even the Master Room is something you\(aqd have to add to it. The other
option is to import an existing database, though to choose that option you\(aqd
also have to have access to an existing database.
.sp
Besides the brand new database that can be made on\-demand, RhostMUSH comes with
two databases that you can use to get your start. One is called \(aqMinimal\(aq and
the other is called \(aqAmbrosia\(aq after the lead RhostMUSH developed that made it.
Despite the name, they\(aqre both fairly minimal, there\(aqs no grid in either, but
what you get is a lot of pre\-installed softcode and security, as well as a
\fBnetrhost.conf\(ga\fP file that has been tuned to work well with it. Even if you
don\(aqt use those databases you can take ideas for the \fBnetrhost.conf\fP file for
tuning your MUSH or even use some RhostMUSH commands to import that softcode
into your database.
.SS The Choices We Make
.sp
Well, not you\(aqre aware of those three big choices, what they are, and where
you\(aqll run across them. Later in this Handbook we\(aqll be going through those
choices in\-depth. In this chapter, what we\(aqll be doing is using the default
options for for \fBconfsource\fP and \fBnetrhost.conf\fP and a brand new database.
Those options and that blank slate are necessary so that you have in front of
you a working MUSH with only #0 and #1 and get shown the way of building it
into whatever is your dream MUSH, and I know we all have one.
.sp
There will be a chance to make all those other choices later, in fact that
will be happening very soon. There\(aqs a lot of very interesting choices that
you can make with RhostMUSH, too many for anyone to ever be able to use them
all. If you don\(aqt start with mastering the basics, you\(aqll never end up knowing
what are the most RhostMUSH options. I can\(aqt tell you what they are, it\(aqs truly
something you have to discover on your own. Remember, you want to build your
dream MUSH, not mine.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Unless you are intending to start with a brand new database, you must be
aware of it\(aqs needs and expectations for the settings of \fBconfsource\fP and
\fBnetrhost.conf\fP Starter databases tend to distribute with them config
files of at least the options they expect set or not set during the process
of configuring and compiling the server.
.sp
Knowing which database you intend to use is the first choice made of these
initial major configuration options, but that last that is made part of the
MUSH.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Compiling RhostMush
.SS Setup directory permissions
.sp
In order to both compile and run, all of the RhostMUSH files and directories
need to have the proper permissions set. If you obtained the source code
directly from GitHub, it is likely that this step is not required, but there
is no harm in running it anyway:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&./dirsetup.sh
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you did NOT obtain the source code directly from GitHub, it is possible that
even the above script will fail to run with \(aqpermission denied\(aq or similar
errors. It is recommended that you obtain the source code from there, but if
for whatever reason this is not an option, manually adjust your permissions
and then re\-run the automated permission script:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
chmod +rx bin/*.sh src/*.sh game/*.sh game/Startmush game/db_*
\&./dirsetup.sh
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Compile the source code
.sp
Once the source code has been obtained and the proper file and directory
permissions have been set, the RhostMUSH source code is ready to be compiled.
This is typically done through an interactive program where you configure the
options you want to have available to your installation:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
make confsource
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
It is recommended that if you are just starting out with RhostMUSH that you
compile for the first time using the default compile options which have
specifically been tuned to be closest to what the average person would need
or expect. Changing these options before you have a grood grasp of what
they mean and how RhostMUSH works on a deeper level can potentially cause
security issues, reduce compatibility with softcode rom other types of MUSH
servers, as well as waste system resources.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Saving your compile options
.sp
\fBmake confsource\fP will remember the most recent options you used to compile
the source code for the next time you use \fBmake confsource\fP It might still
be a good idea to more permanently save the options you used to attempt to
compile. However, you still might want to have these options saved more
permanently, just in case. At the \fBmake confsource\fP menu there is an
option to save your current settings to a file. If you choose to do this,
you will find the the save file in the \fBbin/\fP directory.
.SS Troubleshooting compile errors
.sp
Should this result in an error, a script has been included to correct the most
common errors, after which you can once more try to compile:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&./bin/script_setup.sh
make confsource
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once the compile process successfully complete, you should be able to start\-up
your new RhostMUSH server. If it complains about missing binaries make sure
they are linked. The provided script will fix this issue, and is not harmful
to run in any situation:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
make links
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Recompiling the source code
.sp
If you plan to use \fBmake confsource\fP to recompile your source, you should
first issue a \fBmake clean\fP before re\-issuing a \fBmake confsource\fP
.sp
A failure to issue \fBmake clean\fP prior to re\-compiling with \fBmake confsource\fP
can potentially leave stale object files which may cause unforseen issues when
running code, including but not limited to random crashes.  Generally whenever
recompiling it\(aqs good to always make clean first.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You may also issue \fBmake source\fP if the \fBMakefile\fP is already defined how
you want it to be.  Please remember to \fBmake clean\fP before \fBmake source\(ga\fP
whenever you alter the code or import new source code.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Configuring the game
.SS Persistent configurable game options
.sp
Upon compiling a RhostMUSH server, if it doesn\(aqt already exist, a
\fBnetrhost.conf\fP is copied into the \fBgame/\fP directory for your game. It
includes useful defaults for most compile\-time options that will work well for
most games, particularly ones using both the default \fBconfsource\fP options and
related database.
.sp
This configuration is derived from \fBdefaults/game/netrhost.conf.default\fP
.sp
While this \fBnetrhost.conf\fP is very well documented and quite easy to change
in some places, but there are also some rather technical options that you it\(aqs
important to know the full implications of this.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The default \fBnetrhost.conf\fP starts the game running on the port \fI4021\fP of
the server. If this is your time creating a MUSH, it is recommended that this
setting is the only one that you potentially change, and only if there is a
good reason to. Ports below 1024 are priviliged ports and can not be used for
this purpose.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Starting the game
.sp
Once done, you start up the system with the following command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&./Startmush
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It will prompt you to start a new db if it doesn\(aqt find one.
.sp
You may also do the commands individually:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[csh] netrhost \-s netrhost.conf >& netrhost.log &
[sh]  netrhost \-s netrhost.conf > netrhost.log 2>&1 &
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS First login to the game
.sp
Once started, log in the #1 character (Wizard) with it\(aqs appropiate
password (no, not \(aqpotrzebie\(aq, but \(aqNyctasia\(aq).  There were private
reasons for the password change.
.sp
Once in, do a @shutdown to save the database.  Then you can run Startup
normally.   You may make a backup of your database at anytime on\-line by
utilizing the @dump/flat option.  A script comes with this distribution
that allows the ability of auto\-archiving your database for a configurable
number of backups.
.SS Creating RHostMUSH with a Provided DB
.SS Important before you actually start building
.sp
The main parts of making your RhostMUSH, easy pleasy:

.UNINDENT
.SS Using the prebuilt flatfile
.sp
There are pre\-loaded flatfile databases you can use at this point.  The netrhost.db.flat

.SH WHAT RHOSTMUSH IS ABOUT AND WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT RHOSTMUSH
.sp
RhostMUSH was founded in 1989, originally by Natasha Davis (Nyctasia) and as
a branch from the original release of TinyMUD code.  It was her desire to make
a game that was flexible, with multiple levels of progression and highly
customizeable.  She lost time and interest and passed the game to
Steve Shivers (Seawolf), Mike McDermott (Thorin), and Jace Hoppel (Ashen\-Shugar)
.sp
Through their work, the stability improved, we fixed it to be multi\-platform
and as bug free as we could possibly make it.  We introduced several methods both
in game and in source that allowed consistent memory bounds checking and
various alerts for any mischievous naughtyness in\-game or possibilities of any
hacks, patches, or alterations in the code causing leaks or issues.
.sp
While not perfect, it has allowed us to have an absolutely outstanding
turn around for any bugs sent our way, which anyone who uses RhostMUSH will
attest to.
.sp
Over the years, others have joined the RhostMUSH team, including Ambrosia
(who is the current dev lead), Lensman, Kage (who kindly provided the
UTF8/unicode port), Jeff/Loki, Rook, Noltar, and Odin.
.sp
We also have had hundreds of people who have offered (and provided) help,
patches, suggestions, bug fixes, and alternations all on their own and
every single one will have had their name mentioned in the RHOST.CHANGES
file in the readme directory.  It\(aqs far too large to have in the online
help files.
.sp
RhostMUSH today provides an amazing tool that allows nearly entire
customization in\-game of every single feature available in Rhost without
having the requirement to modify the hardcode.  This includes but is
not limited to:
.SS Recycle bin
.sp
Yup, you guessed it.  RhostMUSH has a windows like recycle bin.
This means the objects you @nuke and @destroy become \(aqdestroyed\(aq
but not recycled until they are @purged.  If you use the Myrddin
CRON in the Mushcode directory, it by default sets up a job
to purge anything over 30 days old, which should be more than
sufficient for any needs.  The goodness of this?  You can recover
nuked things from any period of time, as long as they were not
@purged first.
.sp
Commands: @purge, @nuke, @destroy, @recover, @reclist
.SS @snapshot
.sp
Live image snapshots to unload or load to and from
disk.  As many snapshots as you want, as often as you want.
It essentially does a flatfile dump of a dbref#.  Great for
backups or cross\-Rhost portability.

Functions and commands can both be overridden with softcode.  To

There are various levels of ignoring so that you could have it
ignored from mortals but have it executed fine for non\-mortals.
This allows you to use the actual physical command within a
softcode override.  You may also use @Hook for altering how
a command works.   Functions are overridden by setting the
function in question ignored, then writing a softcode alternative
that is then executed and fetched appropriately.

can do, and then additional stuff on top of it.  The highest bitlevel
is #1 itself, being bitlevel 7.  Then immortal, which should be
considered the #1 character in most cases and is bitlevel 6.  Then
the royalty character, which is equal to wizard on penn, mux, or
other codebases.  For most things, this is the bitlevel you want
to assign players.  The exception will likely be game owners or

.IP \(bu 2

.SS @powers are INHERITED
.sp
Therefore, you need power_objects enabled (@admin)
to make this work properly for non\-plauyers.
A power is taken before a bit level ONLY if higher than that bit.
Yes, powers are multi\-level.
.SS @depowers are automatically checked first before anything else
.sp
This is also meaningless on objects.
.SS Zones are unique
.sp
You can have things in multiple zones.
.SS The db auto\-repares itself when it can

It does this by purging anything
it can\(aqt identify.  Dataloss is better than unrecoverable data.
Yes, any such \(aqrepairing\(aq is logged so you know if something is up.
.SS You can get your connect.txt to parse ansi

.SH WHAT FLAGS, TOGGLES, POWERS, AND DEPOWERS MEAN IN RHOSTMUSH
.SS What are Flags?
.sp
Flags are pretty much exactly the same as any other mush.  It\(aqs a flag
that you set or unset on a target which then enables/disables or
alters something that target can do.  There\(aqs help on all the flags
in help and wizhelp.
.SS What are Toggles?
.sp
Toggles were designed as a single point flag that immediately enables
or disables a set ability or condition, thus a \(aqtoggle\(aq.  It works
exactly like a flag and was originally designed for two reasons.  To
distinguish from the multi\-meaning of a \(aqflag\(aq, and because frankly
we ran out of flag space :)
.SS What is an @power?
.sp
A power is similar to a power on other mushes, but unlike them, our
powers are multi\-tier.  This means that they can be customized to
empower something at a given bitlevel.  You may empower something
from guildmaster up to councilor level.  There are some powers
with a power level of N/A meaning they are a toggle power granting
an absolute power level as specified in the help for that power.
This requires the INHERIT flag for non\-players to inherit powers,
however, a specific object can be granted a power as well.
.SS What is an @depower?
.sp
This is the anti\-thesis of @power.  Also, depowers do not require
inheritance.  They also have priority over flags, toggles, and
powers.  You can use depower to remove or lower abilities and
control from a target, even a full wizard (royalty) can be
depowered.
.SH MULTI-TIERED BITLEVEL SYSTEMS

Please keep in mind each of these bitlevels can be tweeked with the @admin

The only thing this bitlevel can not do is directly effect #1,
set/unset some internal flags/attributes, and set/unset the

.SS What may need to be modified to get softcode from PennMUSH, TinyMUSH2, TinyMUSH3, or MUX2 to work on Rhost
.sp
RhostMUSH, for the most part, will work out of the box with most softcode gotten
from other codebases.  There are, however, exceptions.  Most of these exceptions
will be minor code differences between how ANSI is processed, the variences
of arguments or switches to commands or functions, or required flags.
.sp
Most changes will revolve around the ones listed in this document.
.SS Problematic functions between codebases
.sp
lsearch()/search(), align()/printf(), *attrval()
.SS Problematic features between codebases
.sp
named variables for regexp patterns in $commands are not supported.
@aliases on non\-players are not supported.  Frankly I find them redundant.
.SS Problematic commands
.sp
@mapsql, hardcoded required comssytem commands (some are redundant)
.SS SIDEFX flag
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Anything that uses sideeffects \-\-DIRECTLY\-\- requires this flag.
Sideeffects are like set(), pemit(), and so forth.  list(), while a
side\-effect, does not require this flag as it is considered passive and safe.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Variable exits
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Rhost handles them slightly different.  You do not link
exits to #\-4.  That\(aqs an invalid destination.  I always found it, frankly,
stupid to save any data in the database that was literally invalid.  So,
you link the exit as you normally would, then @toggle the exit variable.
At that point you use @exitto like you would any other codebase.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Zones
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Zones actually can work near exactly as you would expect them to
work on TinyMUSH, MUX, or Penn.  Either at once or at different times.
We recognize multiple zones, zone masters, zone inheritance, zone
parenting, zone command processing, and the ability to bypass zones
entirely.  There\(aqs a ton of flexbility with this.  However, the syntax
for adding/removing zones is different so the commands will have to be
ported to Rhost.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS @powers
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Powers work a bit differently in Rhost and they\(aqre named
differently, which should not be that big a surprise as they\(aqre different
between all the codebases anyway.  The big difference is our powers are
tiered, meaning the can be limited or grown to a given bitlevel and are
not just toggle powers like the other codebases.  We also have @depower
that is the anti\-thesis of @power
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Attribute length
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
While we have 64 character attribute capabilities like
most other codebases, PennMUSH allows 1024 attribute length attributes.
Why you need one that long boggles the mind, but if you do use attribs
that long you need to make sure they are cut down to the proper length.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Attribute contents
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You\(aqll be happy to know that Rhost allows upwards
to 64,000 bytes of data to be assigned an LBUF.  We strongly recommand
to cap at 32,000 however as the various TCP socket protocols play nicer
with that value.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS 256 color
.sp
Yup!  We got it.
.SS Unicode/UTF8
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Yup!  We got this too.  Not quiet yet in the main branch,
but download Kage\(aqs branch, you won\(aqt be dissapointed.  We will have
UTF8 in Rhost 4.0 when released.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Attributes per object
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This is configurable with the VLIMIT @admin
command, however, it is absolutely hard\-limited at 10000 maximum.
This is to avoid any DoS type situation and because frankly there
should never be a reason to exceed that.  If you need more, use
@clusters.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Destroying
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
@nuke only works on players.  @destroy works on non\-players.
Never the two will meet.  We also have a built in recycle bin meaning
anything destroyed will not be automatically recycled.  If you want it
recycled, you have to @purge it.  Yes, if you use  Myrddin\(aqs CRON, it
has a built in entry to auto\-purge anything older than 30 days.  This
also means you can on\-line recover anything destroyed before that 30
days.  Groovy, eh?
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS object id\(aqs
.sp
Yup, we got them.  Even in searches, and, well, everything.
.SS lsearch() and search()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
lsearch() in Penn is not syntacically similar to non\-Penn search().
This will have to be altered.  In addition, search() in non\-penn games
have to have special consideration for escaping out the evaled args.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS @locks can be different
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
We have many more lock capabilities and options
so this should be a non\-issue.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Customer user\-locks
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
We do not have custom user\-locks like Penn.  We do, however, have the way
to set encapsulated lock data into an attribute to fetch and compare
against which I find more useful and far more flexible.
See: lockencode(), lockdecode(), and lockcheck()
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Attribute trees
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Unlike Penn, we don\(aqt really have attribute trees.  We do support the
basic capabilities of it for compatibility if you load in softcode that
uses it, but it doesn\(aqt have the advanced features of attribute trees.
Please see \(aqhelp attribute tree\(aq for more information.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Prefix permission locking
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
We do allow prefix permission locking, and some very advanced abilities
of it.  Please see wizhelp on @aflags for more information.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS align() and printf()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
We do not have align().  Most of the code that uses align() will have to
be converted to our printf() (which is compatible but has different syntax)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS MySQL
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
While we support MySQL, we do not have an async method like MUX2.  This
is just not possible, sorry.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Mail System
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
There are mail wrappers to mimic MUX/TM3 and Penn mail systems.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Comsystem
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The softcoded comsystem mimics MUX/TM3 and Penn\(aqs comsystem.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Various Functions
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
There is a \(aqsoftcode.minmax\(aq in the Mushcode directory that loads up a slew
of @function wrappers that will emulate various functions that MUX, Penn, or
TM3 has.  We have the functionality for nearly all of them, but either our
functions have different syntax, or we have different named functions that
duplicate the functionality.  It would be far better to recode it to use
the native functions, but the @function wrappers are there for lazyness :)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Empty Attributes
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Penn allows you to have empty attributes.  Non\-penn codebases do not.
Thus, hasattrval and the like are not needed and should likely just point
to hasattr instead.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Player Stats
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
MUX has some built in ways for player stats.  We do as well but they\(aqre
either done via functions or attribute contents.  Code that requires this
will have to be recoded.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Percent Substitutions
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Some percent substitutions may differ between codebases.  Luckily, Rhost
allows the ability to remap or creaete new ones if this is a problem.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Switches
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Some switches may not exist in Rhost that do in other codebases, in such
a case, Rhost does allow the ability to @hook a command to define your own
softcoded switch to a hardcoded command and work around the limitation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Adding Flags
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Some flags may be missing.  If it\(aqs a dummy flag, feel free to use the
marker flags MARKER0 to MARKER9 to set them.  If it\(aqs an existing flag
that does similar features, feel free to flag_alias it or just flag_name
it to the other name if you want.
.UNINDENT

.SH DATABASE
.SS Loading an existing Database
.sp
To load in a previous database, you run the db_load script.
.sp
From the game directory you would type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm yourflatfilehere data/netrhost.db.new
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You may also do: ./Startmush
Then you just follow the prompts to load in your flatfile there.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you wish to have #1\(aqs password reset to \(aqNyctasia\(aq please add this
to the bottom of your netrhost.conf file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
newpass_god 777
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The caveat is that you must not have any netrhost.db* or netrhost.gdbm* files
in your data directory prior to loading it in.  It\(aqll error out if previous
files exist.  So you will need to move all files that start with netrhost.db*
and all files that start with netrhost.gdbm* to another directory.
.sp
Your flatfile tends to be named \(aqnetrhost.db.flat\(aq which is in your data
directory.  You can, however, name your flatfile anything you want and have
it in any directory you want.
.sp
To make a flatfile in game, you just issue @dump/flat.  You can specify
a filename after it, otherwise it assumes the name \(aqnetrhost.db.flat\(aq.
.SS Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH
.sp
In the ~/Server/convert directory there is a script called \(aqdoconvert.sh\(aq
.sp
This script will convert most flatfiles from existing mush engines to
RhostMUSH.  The exception is PennMUSH 1.8.0 and later.  For this there is a
BETA converter penn18x_converter.tgz.  This is proven to work, most of the time,
with codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not been fully vetted with
the latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies.
.sp
To convert a non\-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you first
need a valid flatfile of the game you\(aqre wanting to convert.  Please refer
to the documentatation of the mush engine in question (MUX, Penn 1.7, TM2/3)
on how to do this.  Once you have it type::
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&./doconvert.sh FLATFILETOCONVERT FLATFILEOUTPUT
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this instance, FLATFILETOCONVERT will be the filename (with full path) to
the flatfile you are wishing to convert.
.sp
The FLATFILEOUTPUT is anyfilename you wish to name the RhostMUSH converted
flatfile.  I suggest netrhost_converted.db.flat so you know by the name
what it is.
.sp
Follow what it asks for and just let it do its thing.
.SS Note about Compiling
.sp
If you are importing a MUX2 flatfile, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that you select
mux passwords as a compatibility option, or you will NOT BE ABLE to log in
to players as the password will not be recognizeable.
.sp
Make sure to keep QDBM selected as it\(aqs a much more stable database engine
that does not have attribute limit restrictions like GDBM does.
.sp
If you are converting from a Penn, TinyMUSH, or MUX database, make sure you
drill down into the LBUF section and select, at minimum, 8K lbufs.  You likely
want that anyway as it gives you far more room for attribute content storage.
.sp
You can go up to 32K safely.  While 64k is safe and does work, there are issues
with networking and older routers that use a 32K TCP buffer size that can
at times cut off the data as overflow resulting in output to the end\-point
players not receiving their data.  So it is strongly recommended not to go
above 32K in lbuffer size.
.sp
Go ahead and select 64 char attributes.  It allows you to have 64 characters
for attribute names.  It\(aqs handy to have.
.sp
If you wish at this point to set up mysql and/or sqlite, you  may do so.
Yes, you can use them in parallel without any issue.

.SS AmbrosiaDB Bitlevels
.sp
The whole DB is highly geared for a low\-bitlevel setup.
I am a strong believer in least\-privileges\-needed to do the job. Bittypes and
powers are tools to do that job, not badges of friendship or trust that get
tossed about.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Here is my suggested list of powers and bittypes for staffers.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS AmbrosiaDB Storytellers
.sp
@powered TEL_ANYWHERE, JOIN_PLAYER and GRAB_PLAYER on Guildmaster level.
.SS AmbrosiaDB Builder\-BCs
.sp
Mortal, with @quota and money for their job. There should be one
shared BC for each area of the game, like BC\-Houston. Special
Rooms, items or exits that require privilegs to examine or @tel
a player should belong to a BC\-Houston\-Powered that is @powered
EXAMINE_ALL, LONG_FINGERS And TEL_ANYTHING on Guildmaster level.
If the object actually needs to modify a player directly, have
it use a restricted staff Global, or if you absolutely must,
make a BC\-Houston\-Admin and @set it Architect. Do not give
normal builders access to it, only @chown things to it and @set
them inherit after review.
.sp
Both the \-powered and \-admin BCs can have random passwords and
be @set NO_CONNECT.
.SS AmbrosiaDB Building Head
.sp
@set Guildmaster, powered TEL_ANYWHERE, TEL_ANYTHING and
optionally CHOWN_OTHER on Guildmaster level. Mind that the
latter technically allows them to @chown anything guildmaster\-
and lower\-owned in the master and auxiliary rooms. However,
it allows the Building Head to @chown items between BCs\- and
to the BC\-<location>\-powered.
.SS AmbrosiaDB Enforcers
.sp
As Storyteller above, plus being @powered Security at
Guildmaster level, in order to handle problem players.
.sp
Optionally always given to Storytellers.
.SS AmbrosiaDB Coders
.sp
@set Architect
.SS AmbrosiaDB Head Coder
.sp
Always trust your head coder.
@set Architect for the everyday bit. Give access to a
maintenance Councilor bit for special code projects. Finished
code along those lines should get @chowned to the
bc\-admin\-councilor.
.sp
If you as the MU* Head(s) don\(aqt know Softcode well, or want to
leave anything Code to your Head Coder, also give them optional
access to a maintenance Royalty bit in order to properly code
banning/blacklisting +commands and other rare code that requires
Royalty powers. Again, chown finished code to bc\-admin\-royalty.
.SS AmbrosiaDB MU* Head(s)
.sp
You\(aqre the boss(es). But please use an Architect bit for your
everyday things. Keep Immortal to yourself. Keep #1 to yourself.
And seriously avoid using either of them except for creating
a Royalty bit or doing intricate DB maintenance.
.SS AmbrosiaDB Site Admins
.sp
They already have more powers than any in\-game bit can ever
have ;)
.sp
Depending on actual involvement with your game, their abilities
in\-game can range from merely being @powered free_wall for
notifying players of downtimes and/or being @powered shutdown in
order to shut down the game for maintenance, up to being the
only person with actual access to #1.
.SS AmbrosiaDB Globals
.sp
Handle necessary functionality for adminning through the admin\-only globals and
softcode.
.sp
The setup I personally suggest is to have ALL staffers be AT MAX Architect\-level
for everyday work and communication, with special coders that \-really\- require
it having Councilor\-characters available to log into for maintenance or special
code setup. Technically if everything is done right, the Coder(s) of the game do
not require higher privileges than Architect for the vast majority of things.
Royalty\-level code should be a rare exception, if at all necessary. The MU*
Head(s) or site\-admin should be the only one having access to #1, Immortals or
perhaps even Royalty. The BC\(aqs, Global Function objects and Function objects at
level Royalty and higher have simply been provided as a if\-necessary convenience.
.sp
Current objects are only @chowned to certain bitlevels if it is really required
for them to function. Whenever possible, they have been @chowned to the mortal
BC\-Admin\-Mortal. All custom global functions listed above are on the semi\-
\-mortal Global Functions object. The Master Room and Auxiliary Room have been
@chowned to BC\-Admin\-Architect.
.sp
The Comsystem and +bboard are owned by BC\-Admin\-Architect, which means that
higher bitlevels might not be able to use those systems if they hide and set
themselves DARK. This is intentional. The Architect bitlevel is enough to freely
set attributes on players, so these systems did not need anything higher, and
it prioritizes Councilor+ as mere mainenance\-duty bitlevels. Even the MU* Head
should log on as an Architect for everyday things.
.sp
The Comsystem and BBOARD have been modified to be configurable by Architect and
higher. Both systems have a CANUSE attribute with the according code on them.
Note that if you want both systems to be only configurable by Councilor+, that
instead of @chowning them to a Councilor after changing those attribute for
Councilor or higher, I suggest to simply @set the bboard and comsystem core
objects NO_MODIFY instead, keeping them at Architect\-power but making them
unmodifyable by Architects.
.SS AmbrosiaDB Quota
.sp
I highly recommend the use of the alternative @quota system. BC\-Admin\-Mortal
and BC\-Admin\-Guildmaster both have this @quota system set up on themselves. Both
of them have a high amount of money for everyday operations. You should not give
them free quota or money.
.SS AmbrosiaDB Adding Functions
.sp
I also recommend to setup most global functions with /Privileged even if they
are mortal\-powered, to make them work even when players are set NO_CODE and
WANDERER by default.
.sp
Enjoy!
.SS AmbrosiaDB Compiling
.sp
P.S. the \(aqbin/asksource.save0\(aq file has been supplied for loading in the
\(aqmake config\(aq or \(aqmake confsource\(aq step of Rhost installation. It provides the
settings I have used when creating this database. Some settings, like the ANSI
substitution, are used in the DB.

.SS Considerations to locking down restrictions in RhostMUSH
.sp
Sometimes, you want to have things run at various privilage levels and do not
want to have things with too much access.  Weither that is online objects or
players you want to block from connecting to your mush.  Here\(aqs things you can
do.
.sp
One thing to keep in mind is that RhostMUSH, unlike PennMUSH is not flag
dependant on permission level, it\(aqs ownership based.  While setting a wizard
flag on an object would work, it\(aqs not recommended and it is instead recommended
to chown the object in question to a wizard (like your wizard holder character)
Then the object must be set inherit to actually inherit the wizard.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
inherit is required to inherit anything from the player.  Flags, powers,
toggles.  The only thing that is inherited automatically is depowers.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Online: Blocking object abilities
.sp
We have various flag levels.  It is strongly recommanded you check wizhelp
on \(aqcontrol\(aq for a detailed overview of what each bitlevel can or can not do
prior to giving the ownership to the object.  Things useful for tweaking control
on players and objects.

GUEST       \- This is your guest flag, it should only be set on guests
WANDERER    \- the WANDERER flag is default on new players.  This flag disables all building abilitites of the player.
NO_COMMAND  \- You can use this to stop a player from being able to connect without worrying about changing their password
FUBAR       \- As the flag states, it f*\(aqs them up beind all recognition.  It essentially stops them from doing absolutely anything in the mush but pose and say.  Yes, it even disables the quit command.
SLAVE       \- Funny enough, slave allows anything but say and pose.  To ruin a troll\(aqs life, set both FUBAR and SLAVE and sit back and smile.
NO_TEL      \- The target can\(aqt teleport or be teleported
NO_MOVE     \- The target is locked at their location unable to move at all
NO_WALL     \- They do not see any @wall except a wizard @wall/no_prefix.  This has the bonus of snuffing db save messages.
NO_POSSESS  \- Sometimes it\(aqs useful to grant a builder character to multiple players.  The NO_POSSESS flag makes it so that player can not be logged in more than 2 times.
NO_MODIFY   \- The target can not be modified (except by immortal/#1)
NO_EXAMINE  \- The target can not be examined/decompiled (except by immortal/#1)
STOP        \- Once a matching $command is found on an object set STOP, it \(aqstops\(aq trying to find other $command matches.
NOSTOP      \- If a target that is set STOP is also set NOSTOP, it will check the master room for a command and execute that as well if found.
NO_PESTER   \- Stops target from @pemit or whisper.  You may use @icmd as well.
NO_OVERRIDE \- Useful for immortals.  By default they override all locks, including attribute locks.  This makes it so an immortal\(aqs passing of locks will behave like a mortals
NO_USELOCK  \- This is like NO_OVERRIDE but only effects uselocks.  You likely want to set this on your immortal and wizard.
NO_ANSINAME \- stops a target from having an ansified name
NO_CODE     \- lock down advanced coding from a target
SPAMMONITOR \- stop a target from issuing more than 60 commands a minute.
FREE        \- Stop costing money for day to day processing of commands/building

because some situations require a differentating MTU value such as
briged network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or
similar encapsulated network services.  However, this option has
several settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies

.SS Note about Patching
.sp
There\(aqs two ways you can look to patch the source.  If you plan to run the
RhostMUSH source from a git repository, then please use the git repo to
constantly update your code.  If you knew enough to want to set up a git repo
then we expect knowledge on how to keep source trees updated in the git repo
to be used the same as any other source distribution.
.sp
If, however, you have no idea what a git repo even is, or have no inclination
of using git to manage your RhostMUSH source, or just don\(aqt care one way
or another, then you can use the included patch.sh routine (from under the
Server directory) to patch your source at any time.
.sp
From the server directory just type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&./patch.sh
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
That will auto\-compile your source, auto make all your header files and
essentially keep everything up to date to the latest source.
Once that\(aqs done, all you do from within the game is two commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.SS Daily Backups for RhostMUSH
.sp
Make SURE YOU RUN DAILY Backups.  Rhost is very stable, but things outside the mush can damage the game. paranoia is fine, especially when they really are out to get you.  TO make the backups, do the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 @dump/flat      \-\- This makes a flatfile dump of the main database.  You want to run this daily.
 wmail/unload    \-\- This makes a flatfile dump of the mail database.  You want to run this daily.
 @areg/unload    \-\- Only worry about this if you are using auto\-registration emailing.  Few do.
 newsdb/unload   \-\- Only worry if you use the hardcoded bbs system.  Most don\(aqt use it.


Backups are already handled and integrated with a script \(aqbackup_flat.sh\(aq.
If you wish to customize this, feel free.  Again, it is well documented and
just require changing settings at the top of this script.

By default, it does 7 contiguous backups.  You may increase or decrease
this value to any value you want.

It will, by default, backup all your txt/\e*.txt files, your netrhost.conf
file, your netrhost.db.flat (mush db) file, your RhostMUSH.dump.\e*
(mail db) files, your RhostMUSH.news.\e* (internal news/bbs db \-\- if used),
your RhostMUSH.areg.\e* (the autoregistration db \-\- if used), and any sqlite
database you currently may be using which are OPTIONALLY backed up if you
remove the \(aq#\(aq from before it.

The backup script also will optionally rcp/scp, ftp, or mail any backups
you want to a remote destination.  Be forewarned, the backup files can
potentially get rather large for larger games, even compressed.  The
average size for these files will be 1\-5MB.  It could potentially get
over 10\-20MB in size for excessively large games, so plan accordingly.

Be aware that the backup system will NOT make successful backups if you
run out of disk space.  This includes actually running out of disk space
or running out of disk quota.  There is a mechanism inside the backup
script to specify an email address that you wish to get alerts from
in these instances.  I recommend using it.

If you make changes to your backup_flat.sh script with an already
active and running mush and wish to just restart the backup procedure
just issue::

   ./backup_restart.sh

.SS Signals and why you need them for control
.sp
Rhost by default allows signals at the shell to handle various processes in\-game.
.sp
The following signals are useful.
.SS TERM (kill \-TERM or kill \-15)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
This will immediately terminate the mush, dumping a special flatfile called
netrhost.db.TERM and scramming the db in question by force\-closing it
without any writes.  A TERM is the effort for the mush to shut down the
mush as fast as possible to avoid any db corruption if possible since
a TERM signal is common during a server shutdown, so time is paramount.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS USR1 (kill \-USR1)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.IP \(bu 2
This by default issues a reboot on the server.  This is a special parameter
because this can actually be changed in\-game to do any number of other
things.  Please refer to the RhostMUSH running in question if this is
the default behavior or if the method for USR1 is doing something else.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS USR2 (kill \-USR2)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.IP \(bu 2
This will shutdown (cleanly) the mush.  This behaves as if you issued
a @shutdown from within the game, and follows all proper procedure
in bringing the game down cleanly and safely.  This shoudl be used
when doing maintenance on the game or if you need to bring it down
from the shell.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS KILL (kill \-KILL or kill \-9)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
This signal can not be caught and will immediately terminate the game
without any safty to the database at all.  Short of something horribly
wrong going on, this should never be used to bring down your mush.
Doing so will almost certainly corrupt your databases (ALL OF THEM)
that are open, including but not limited to your main database, your
mail database, your autoregistration database, and so forth.  So if
you do this, plan to do some database recovery from your flat files.
Also, when you bring down a mush in this manner, you need to issue
Startmush \-f to bring it back up.

database, especially a QDBM database, you will likely have just corrupted your
database, so pull out a flatfile to recover.
.sp
Sadly, this also may occur if the server hosting you takes a nose\-dive in the middle

.SS Stack limit and debugging
.sp
Rhost uses a stack limit in the debug monitor.
.sp
This stack limit is set to a reasonable amount of 1000.
This is defined in the debug.h file in the hdrs directory.
.sp
This will directly impact the function_recursion_limit from being
set above 100.  If, for whatever reason, you really must have
a ridiculously high recursion limit, then it is a suggestion to
manually modify the stack limit in debug.h to a higher number.
.sp
We have reasonably set it to 10000 without too much issue, but keep
in mind, the overhead is higher for every stack you throw on the
process table.  Higher stack means more memory used.

to this value.

.SS Check your mush.config file

mush again.  Try to keep your quota at least 200 megs free to allow
plenty of wonderful growth space for the mush.
.SS Verify you have enough disk space.  (system)
.sp
The second way you can run out of disk space is by the filesystem itself.
do a df \-h . in your \(aqgame\(aq directory\(aq.  That is df \-h <period>.
This will return how much disk space is being used and how much remains.
If it shows 100% used, you\(aqre out of disk space and the db is corrupt.
.sp
At this point, you\(aqre pretty screwed.  You can see if anything exists
in your system to free up some space, but if the filesystem itself
is filled, reach out to the owner of the server and let them know.
It\(aqs a much bigger deal than just your mush if that\(aqs the case.

Ok, at this point you likely had your mush up when the physical server
went down hard.  Weither through an emergency shutdown or a physical
power outage, your db likely was brought down hard during a write,
so it left it in a corrupt state.  These things happen.  This is

out of it, but otherwise it\(aqs a lost cause.  You\(aqll have to start
over from scratch.  I\(aqm sorry.
.SS The good news
.sp
If you made backups, or if the server had a normal shutdown, you
likely have a flatfile backup.  You will see a netrhost.db.flat
in either the \(aqdata\(aq directory or \(aqprevflat\(aq directory.  That
is your manual flatfile backup.

If the server had a normal shutdown, you will see a file called
netrhost.db.TERMFLAT.  This is a scram\-emergency db flatfile.
It attempts to write this at the time of server shutdown to
hopefully keep a clean backup in the case of issues since
it identifies the server is coming down hard.  Make sure
if you plan to use the TERMFLAT as your recovery flatfile
that the very last line shows something like ** END OF DUMP **.
That shows you had a successful backup.
.SS Now, to restore your database?

Please refer to the file \(aqREADME.DBLOADING\(aq.
.SS Bringing up your mail database
.sp
Your mail db may or may not come up at this point.
.SS If after restoring main database your mail database works
.sp
If your mail database came up and does not show
\(aqMail: mail is currently off\(aq then you should be good to go.

wmail/fix fixes the mail.
.sp
wmail/lfix loads in the fixes.
.SS If after restoring main database your mail database does not work
.sp
If your mail database is not up and shows \(aqMail: mail is currently off\(aq then your mail db is currupt.
.SS Dealing with a corrupt mail database
.sp
It says when you try to access mail that mail is disabled and/or off.
.sp
Nothing you do can bring it on line.  Well, this is bad, but not horrible.
.sp
The mail db is totally separate from the main game database.  This means
that it in no way damaged or corrupted your main mush database.
.sp
The bad news?  Yes.  Your mail database is corrupt.  To bring it back,
is it hopes that you read ahead of time about how to backup your mush,
which would include the mail database.
.SS Backing up your mail database
.sp
You should be making a flatifile dump of mail db daily by running on the MUSH:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
wmail/unload
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To recover your mail, it assumes you have a mail flatfile in either the
~/Server/game/data directory or the ~/Server/game/prevflat directory.  The
latter directory is used in junction to the backup_flat.sh and will always
house the latest flatfile if not one recently dumped in your data directory.
.SS Automatically recovering your mail database
.sp
If you have a flatfile dump of your mail db, run this command on the MUSH:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
wmail/load
.ft P

wmail/fix  \-\- this fixes the mail database and sync\(aqs it to the mush db.
wmail/lfix \-\- this loads in the fixed mail database
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you have a very old mail database, this is likely going to be required
to sync against nuked players and other changes to the game since the flatfile.
.sp
If this is a new db that you have, you can skip the fixing.
.SS Manually recovering your mail database
.sp
To recover your mail manually, you need to delete your mail databases,
reboot, then reload your mail flatfiles.  If you have no mail flatfiles,
well, you\(aqre going to have to start over with the mail database.  Sorry.
.sp
First, go into the \(aqgame\(aq subdirectory.  Inside that directory is a \(aqdata\(aq
directory.
.sp
You will be deleting all the files with the following names:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
RhostMUSH.mail.*                (like RhostMUSH.mail.dir/RhostMUSH.mail.pag)

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
DO NOT DELETE OTHER NAMED FILES!!!
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once these files are deleted, you may issue a @reboot to restart the mush.
This will unlock the mail system and load in a fresh db.
.sp
Now, if you have flatfiles of the old mail database, you will see in either
the \(aqdata\(aq directory or the \(aqprevflat\(aq directory files that are called:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
RhostMUSH.dump.folder
RhostMUSH.dump.mail
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Make sure these two files are in the \(aqdata\(aq subdirectory.  Copy them in
if they exist in your \(aqprevflat\(aq directory.
.sp
Once they are in the \(aqdata\(aq directory, within the mush type: wmail/load
.sp
This loads in the flatfile and recover the mail database.
.sp
Now, at this point the mail db may not be 100% in\-sync with the game db.
.sp
So let\(aqs fix it.
.sp
wmail/fix   \-\- this will run a fix on the mail db and repair any issues.
.sp
wmail/lfix  \-\- this will load the fixed flatfile back into the mush.
.sp
At this point you should be good to go.
.SH ADVANCED FEATURES
.SS Adding hardcoded modules
.sp
RhostMUSH does support module writing.
.SS Modifying sourcode to add a module
.sp
This requires hooking your changes into local.c, then modifying the Makefile (in the src directory)
for any new source files that you wish to add.
.sp
Something to be aware of is that all localized data is ran after the system cache subroutine.
.SS Adding an @startup to make use of modules
.sp
This means that if your code is depending on @startups, you need to put a delay in the @startup
so that your local code can be loaded in as modules prior to the @startup execution.
.sp
Something that will not work:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
@startup me=@superhappyfuncommand loadmeup=now
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A small alteration that will likely make this work fine:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
@startup me=@wait 1=@superhappyfuncommand loadmeup=now
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
That 1 second delay for the queue will give the game engine time to load in your module code.
.SS Contributing your module back to Rhost
.sp
If you wish your modules to be part of the main Rhost distribution you have two options:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Attempt to hack the bin/asksource.sh and bin/asksource.blank files.
.IP 2. 3
Ask one of the Rhost devs to do it for you :)

.SS Reality Levels Setup
.sp
Reality levels are a means to forbid (or allow) interaction between objects
in the same location.
.SS Reality Levels Visibility
.sp
Each object (player, room, exit, thing) has two lists of reality levels.
An Rx list, which describe what it can see and a Tx list, which describe
where it can be seen. Those are bitfields. In order for X to see Y a bitwise
\(aqand\(aq is performed between X\(aqs RxLevel and Y\(aqs TxLevel. If the result is not
0, then X sees Y. If the result is 0, as far as X is concerned, Y doesn\(aqt
exist. This affects contents lists, exit lists, look, say, pose, @emit,
@verb, connect/disconnect, has arrived/has left messages, exit and object
matching. \(aqhere\(aq and \(aqme\(aq match always.
.sp
It doesn\(aqt affect @remit, @pemit, page, WHO or channels.
By default, all new objects are created with an RxLevel of 1 and TxLevel of
1. Rooms are an exception, created with an RxLevel of 1 and a TxLevel of
0xFFFFFFFF. Those default levels can be changed with configuration
parameters.
.sp
An object is always visible to itself, even if its Rx and Tx levels don\(aqt
match. (See examples below)
.SS Reality Levels Descriptions
.sp
For every reality level defined, you can define an attribute that serves as
description. If you look at something and match more than one of its
TxLevels, you\(aqll see all the corresponding descriptions on the target
object. If the object doesn\(aqt have any descriptions for the matching levels,
you\(aqll see the regular @desc.
.sp
The @adesc attribute on the target is only triggered if the target can see
the looker in turn. It\(aqs only triggered once, no matter how many descs the
looker sees. The @odesc is shown only to those people that see /both/ the
looker and the target.
.sp
Through extension, @afail/@ofail and similar pairs (@adrop/@odrop,
@asucc/@osucc etc) work in the same way. @verb commands are similary
affected.
.sp
Softcoded commands are only matched on the objects that can see the player.
The player doesn\(aqt have to see the object. This includes commands in the
Master Room.
.sp
Exits are treated specially. In order to be able to use an exit name (or to
use the \(aqmove <exit>\(aq command) the exit must be visible to the enactor. In
order to pass through the exit, the exit must see the enactor in turn. There
are reasons for this, which will become evident in the examples below.
.SS Reality Levels Configuration parameters
.sp
A few configuration parameters have been introduced to deal with the reality
levels:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
reality_level <name> <value> [<desc attribute name>]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This directive can only be used in the config file (not with the @admin
command) and should be repeated for each reality level you want to define.
It defines a new level named <name> with a bitvalue of <value> and an
optional desc attribute. There is a limit of 8 characters on <name>, a
32\-bit value on <value> (basically an unsigned long) and 32 characters on
the attribute name. A maximum of 32 reality levels can be defined:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
def_exit_tx <value>
def_exit_rx <value>
def_room_tx <value>
def_room_rx <value>
def_player_rx <value>
def_player_tx <value>
def_thing_rx <value>
def_thing_tx <value>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These 8 directives define the default reality levels of newly created
objects. They can be set in the config file or with the @admin command.
Like above, <value> must be a decimal number:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
wiz_always_real <0|1>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If this parameter is set to 1 then wizards (and immortals on Rhost) will see
everything and will be visible to everyone. Their effective Rx and Tx levels
will always be 0xFFFFFFFF. Also settable in the config file and with the
@admin command.
.sp
Compile with \-DREALITY_LEVELS compile time option to enable \(aqReal\(aq needs to be \(aq1\(aq

.SS Reality Levels Commands
.sp
Two wiz\-only commands are used to set the reality levels of an object:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
@rxlevel <object>=<list>
@txlevel <object>=<list>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
<list> is a space\-separated list of level names that have to be set on the
object. If a level name is prefixed with an exclamation mark (!) that level
will be cleared from the object.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Changing the Tx levels of an object might make it invisible to you.
In this case, you can still manipulate it by using his #dbref (or *player
for players).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Functions
.sp
There are five functions that deal with reality levels:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hasrxlevel(<object>,<level>)
hastxlevel(<object>,<level>)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These two functions check if an object has the specified Rx or Tx level.
You must control <object>. They return 0 or 1 and #\-1 in case the object
does not exist or you don\(aqt have permissions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
rxlevel(<object>)
txlevel(<object>)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These two functions return a space\-separated list of the object\(aqs Rx or Tx
levels. Again, you must control the object:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cansee(<obj1>,<obj2>)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A wiz\-only function, returns 1 of <obj1> can see <obj2> from a reality
levels point of view. It doesn\(aqt check if the objects are in the same
location, the DARK/CLOAKED flags and so on. Just <obj1>\(aqs Rx level against
<obj2>\(aqs Tx level.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If you are using it on MUX2.0 with /both/ reality levels and Wod
Realms enabled, the function will perform both checks and the Wod Realms
version checks against the DARK flag.

.SS Example 1: A simplified Witchcraft setup
.sp
In Witchcraft, besides the various Gifted classes, characters can be spirits
There are spirit realms to which the mundane can not travel. Therefore we
will use 2 reality levels: Real and Ghost. Since some spirits can become
solid for a limited period of time, we will also use an additional desc for
the Ghost level, called GHOSTDESC. Therefore in the config file we will
have:
.INDENT 0.0

A vampire with Obfuscate 2, should not be visible by one with Auspex 1.
However one with Auspex 3 should see another vampire with Obfuscate 1, 2
/or/ 3.
.sp
Obfuscated players can move if they have Obf > 1. Umbral and Shadow players
should also be able to see most of the exits. So the exits at creation
should have default levels of Real + Obf2 + Obf3 + Obf4 + Obf5 + Umbra +
Shadow = 1 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 256 = 381:

Obf1 is not included since an Obfuscated vampire should not be able to move
if it only has Obf1. Therefore they won\(aqt see the exits. If you want them
to be able to see the exits, but not to use them, change the default Tx of
the exits:

Joe the Mortal will have an RxLevel: Real and a TxLevel: Real
Jack the Malk, who likes to walk around Obfuscated and has Obfuscate 2 will
have an RxLevel: Real (he sees what the mortals see) but a TxLevel: Obf2
Jimmy the Nossie, who is using the Mask and has Obfuscate 4, but doesn\(aqt
try to make himself invisible will have an RxLevel: Real (as Jack)
and a TxLevel: Real Obf4. He will also set his @desc to what the mortals see and
&OBFDESC to his real slimy desc. Simply put, he will be visible to mortals,
but not with his real desc.
.sp
Aldrin the Gangrel, has Auspex 4 and activates it. Therefore, his TxLevel
will still be Real, but RxLevel: Real Obf1 Obf2 Obf3 Obf4 (all of them). So
he can see Joe, Jack and Jimmy\(aqs both descs.
Joe, on the other hand, won\(aqt see Jack at all. He will still see Jimmy, but
only Jimmy\(aqs @desc, not the OBFDESC
.sp
Frida the Fae... will have RxLevel: Real Fae and TxLevel: Real Fae. @desc
set to the mundane desc, &FAEDESC set to the Chimerical desc.
Emily the Enchanted will have an RxLevel: Real Fae, but the TxLevel: Real.
No &FAEDESC on her, although she\(aqll be able to see it the one on Frida.
Gil the Garou, while travelling through the Umbra, will have RxLevel: Umbra
and TxLevel: Umbra. &UMBRADESC is his friend. He won\(aqt see mortals or other
characters who are not in the Umbra.
.sp
Barbie the Bastet, who\(aqs only peeking in the Umbra, without going there,
will have RxLevel: Umbra, TxLevel: Real. Dangerous position since she
can\(aqt see the things that see her.
.sp
Deanna the Drake, who activates her spirit vision, will have
RxLevel: Real Umbra and TxLevel: Real. She will see characters in Umbra and
real world at the same time and perceive the desc appropiate to the realm
the ohter character is in.

Wanda the Wraith: RxLevel: Real Shadow, TxLevel: Shadow. Her @desc
would be empty, but the &SHADOWDESC should be set.

Considering the config directives from example 2 and assuming a function
getstat(<dbref>,<stat>) that will return the value of a player\(aqs stat from

In a real game you would have to use some more checks, of course.

While MUSHL_VARS are sanitized on what is allowable as a mush variable, this
is not necessarilly sanitized on what the calling script can fetch as a valid
variable.  Of note, you can not set environment variables that contain an
equals sign.  Be aware of this limitation.
.sp
Remember, MUSHL_VARS is the environment variable seen by the script.
This is EXECSCRIPT_VARS on the mush itself, that is the attribute set
on the target that contains the execscript() that is being executed.

Depending on how old your game is coming from you may need to add more options.  Any config option that is the same between the netrhost.conf files do not have to be copied over, and you want to keep your custom settings (like don\(aqt port or other stuff you have already customized).

The Rhost developers would like to see what was added, and possibly
look at adding them to the main distro if we see others would like
it (with full credits to you), but we belive once you have the code,
you should be allowed to play with it fully as long as the first two
rules are kept.
