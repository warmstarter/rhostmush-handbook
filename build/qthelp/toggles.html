<h1><span class="section-number">6. </span>What FLAGS, TOGGLES, POWERS, DEPOWERS, and BITLEVELS mean in RhostMUSH</h1>
<div class="section" id="flags">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.1. </span>Flags</h2>
<p>Flags are pretty much exactly the same as any other mush.  It’s a flag
that you set or unset on a target which then enables/disables or
alters something that target can do.  There’s help on all the flags
in help and wizhelp.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="toggles">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.2. </span>Toggles</h2>
<p>Toggles were designed as a single point flag that immediately enables
or disables a set ability or condition, thus a ‘toggle’.  It works
exactly like a flag and was originally designed for two reasons.  To
distinguish from the multi-meaning of a ‘flag’, and because frankly
we ran out of flag space :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="power">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.3. </span>&#64;power</h2>
<p>A power is similar to a power on other mushes, but unlike them, our
powers are multi-tier.  This means that they can be customized to
empower something at a given bitlevel.  You may empower something
from guildmaster up to councilor level.  There are some powers
with a power level of N/A meaning they are a toggle power granting
an absolute power level as specified in the help for that power.
This requires the INHERIT flag for non-players to inherit powers,
however, a specific object can be granted a power as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="depower">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.4. </span>&#64;depower</h2>
<p>This is the anti-thesis of &#64;power.  Also, depowers do not require
inheritance.  They also have priority over flags, toggles, and
powers.  You can use depower to remove or lower abilities and
control from a target, even a full wizard (royalty) can be
depowered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-tiered-bitlevel-systems">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.5. </span>Multi-tiered bitlevel systems</h2>
<p>RhostMUSH offers a multi-tier bitlevel system.  They go in order of presidence
You do not have to use all these bits, only use what you want.</p>
<div class="section" id="ghod-1-bitlevel-7">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.1. </span>ghod (#1) &lt;bitlevel 7&gt;</h3>
<p>This bitlevel can do everything.  Only those who you trust with absolute power should have this.  Period.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="immortal-i-level-6-basically-1">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.2. </span>Immortal(i) &lt;Level 6&gt; - Basically #1</h3>
<p>The only thing this bitlevel can not do is directly effect #1,
set/unset some internal flags/attributes, and set/unset the
immortal flag.  These players can do EVERYTHING else.  Treat
this bit as you would treat #1.  Only give it to those you know
without a doubt you can trust.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can do everything except set some internal flags, effect #1, and set/remove the immortal flag.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="royalty-w-level-5-full-wizbit-level">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.3. </span>Royalty(W) &lt;Level 5&gt; - FULL wizbit level</h3>
<p>This is your standard wizard.  They can do everything you’re
used to on other mushes that wizards can do.  In addition, they
also override all locks by default (this can be disabled), and
they have an enhanced wizcloaking ability (which also can be
disabled).  They can also set all the lower bitlevels.</p>

<li><p>All things of Level 4 and lower</p></li>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.4. </span>Councilor(a) &lt;Level 4&gt; - High wizbit level</h3>
<p>This is your almost-but-not-quite wizard.  They have access to
about 80% of the wizard commands.  This includes &#64;nuke, &#64;toad,
&#64;newpassword and the like.  The only things they can’t do that
wizards can is cloak, override locks, and use some of the
database manipulation tools in wizhelp.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All things of Level 3 and lower</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to set more flags: NOCONNECT, WANDERER, FREE</p></li>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.5. </span>Architect(B) &lt;Level 3&gt; - Middle wizbit level</h3>
<p>This is your sub-wizard.  They still have the ability to control
anything their bitlevel and lower (including &#64;chown, &#64;destroy, etc)
but do not have any control of other players (like &#64;nuke, &#64;toad, etc)
but they can set the slave flag.  Otherwise, all things their level
and lower they can treat as if they owned it.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.6. </span>Guildmaster(g) &lt;Level 2&gt; - Lowest wizbit level</h3>
<p>This is the lowest wiz bit.  They only have moderate abilities.
They can examine/decompile anything their level and lower, they can
&#64;guild/&#64;quota people, and they have a few other minor abilities.
They don’t have free money however.</p>

<div class="section" id="wanderer-bitlevel-0">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.7. </span>Wanderer &lt;bitlevel 0&gt;</h3>
<p>This is a hinderance flag.  This flag is automatically set on new
players that are created (which can be disabled).  This flag stops
the player from creating/destroying any database information.   In
effect it stops them from any type of building type commands.  They
still are allowed to set/unset locks/attributes/etc though without
hinderance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guest-bitlevel-0-as-well">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.8. </span>Guest &lt;bitlevel 0 as well&gt;</h3>
<p>This is a bigger hinderance flag.  By default all guests should be
set this.  This flag stops the player from ANY database manipulation
along with &#64;teleporting, and many other advanced commands.  It’s
extreamly dehibilatating.</p>

<div class="section" id="altering-bitlevels">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.6. </span>Altering bitlevels</h2>
<p>Please keep in mind each of these bitlevels can be tweeked with the &#64;admin
parameters and with the &#64;powers (accessable by royalty) or &#64;depowers (only
by immortal and higher).</p>
