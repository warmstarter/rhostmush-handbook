<h1>Stack limit and debugging</h1>
<p>Rhost uses a stack limit in the debug monitor.</p>
<p>This stack limit is set to a reasonable amount of 1000.
This is defined in the debug.h file in the hdrs directory.</p>
<p>This will directly impact the function_recursion_limit from being
set above 100.  If, for whatever reason, you really must have
a ridiculously high recursion limit, then it is a suggestion to
manually modify the stack limit in debug.h to a higher number.</p>
<p>We have reasonably set it to 10000 without too much issue, but keep
in mind, the overhead is higher for every stack you throw on the
process table.  Higher stack means more memory used.</p>
<p>Also be aware that your shell stack limit directly is affected
to this value.</p>
<p>Type: ulimit -a</p>
<p>This will show you your shell stack limits.  Do NOT set the
STACKMAX value higher than your shellâ€™s stack value.</p>
<p>The value in ~/Rhost/Server/hdrs/debug.h is currently set as:</p>
<p>#define STACKMAX 1000</p>
<p>Feel free to change this to a higher value if you wish.</p>
<p>The caveat.  This effects the debug stack daemon.  Meaning,
the only way for this to be updated is through &#64;shutdown and
then a fresh ./Startmush.</p>
<p>A &#64;reboot WILL NOT LOAD IN A NEW DEBUG MONITOR!!!!</p>
<p>You can issue &#64;list stack to see the current stack ceiling ingame.</p>
