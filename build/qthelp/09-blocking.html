There’s multiple ways to stop this.</p>

<h2>Blacklisting through external tor_pull.sh script</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In ~/Rhost/Server/game you will see a script called tor_pull.sh
Execute this by running (from the game directory) ./tor_pull.sh
This populates the blacklist with registered proxies from various sites
on the internet.  If you want specified ip’s added, feel free to add
them at the end of this file.</p>

This will load in the generated blacklist file for automatic forbid

<div><p>&#64;tor.  Please see ‘wizhelp tor’ on how to set this up.  It in effect
will actively block all known exit nodes for TOR’s annonymous proxy
service.  It self-updates and will actively block TOR connections.</p>

<div><p>&#64;admin proxy_checker (please see wizhelp)
This little doodad uses MTU checking against packet size which will
detect most methods of proxies.  Sadly, this also has false positives
because some situations require a differentating MTU value such as
briged network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or
similar encapsulated network services.  However, this option has
several settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies
to downright forbidding them.  If you’re being actively attacked,
it may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection.</p>
