<h1>What RhostMUSH is about and what’s so great about RhostMUSH.</h1>
<p>RhostMUSH was founded in 1989, originally by Natasha Davis (Nyctasia) and as
a branch from the original release of TinyMUD code.  It was her desire to make
a game that was flexible, with multiple levels of progression and highly
customizeable.  She lost time and interest and passed the game to
Steve Shivers (Seawolf), Mike McDermott (Thorin), and Jace Hoppel (Ashen-Shugar)</p>
<p>Through their work, the stability improved, we fixed it to be multi-platform
and as bug free as we could possibly make it.  We introduced several methods both
in game and in source that allowed consistent memory bounds checking and
various alerts for any mischievous naughtyness in-game or possibilities of any
hacks, patches, or alterations in the code causing leaks or issues.</p>
<p>While not perfect, it has allowed us to have an absolutely outstanding
turn around for any bugs sent our way, which anyone who uses RhostMUSH will
attest to.</p>
<p>Over the years, others have joined the RhostMUSH team, including Ambrosia
(who is the current dev lead), Lensman, Kage (who kindly provided the
UTF8/unicode port), Jeff/Loki, Rook, Noltar, and Odin.</p>
<p>We also have had hundreds of people who have offered (and provided) help,
patches, suggestions, bug fixes, and alternations all on their own and
every single one will have had their name mentioned in the RHOST.CHANGES
file in the readme directory.  It’s far too large to have in the online
help files.</p>
<p>RhostMUSH today provides an amazing tool that allows nearly entire
customization in-game of every single feature available in Rhost without
having the requirement to modify the hardcode.  This includes but is
not limited to:</p>
<div class="section" id="recycle-bin">
<h2>Recycle bin</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Yup, you guessed it.  RhostMUSH has a windows like recycle bin.
This means the objects you &#64;nuke and &#64;destroy become ‘destroyed’
but not recycled until they are &#64;purged.  If you use the Myrddin
CRON in the Mushcode directory, it by default sets up a job
to purge anything over 30 days old, which should be more than
sufficient for any needs.  The goodness of this?  You can recover
nuked things from any period of time, as long as they were not
&#64;purged first.
Commands: &#64;purge, &#64;nuke, &#64;destroy, &#64;recover, &#64;reclist</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="snapshot">
<h2>&#64;snapshot</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Live image snapshots to unload or load to and from
disk.  As many snapshots as you want, as often as you want.
It essentially does a flatfile dump of a dbref#.  Great for
backups or cross-Rhost portability.
Command: &#64;snapshot</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wizard-and-immortals-by-default">
<h2>Wizard and Immortals by default</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>are spoofable.  Meaning all their &#64;pemits by default will not
trigger NOSPOOF.  If you do not wish this, set the SPOOF flag
this applies to anyone below their level.</p></li>
<li><p>override all locks.  There’s two flags to disable this.
NO_OVERRIDE to stop overriding all locks (including attribs)
and NO_USELOCK to just stop overriding uselocks.
This applies to anything their level and lower.</p></li>
<li><p>optionally cloak from all non-immortals/God player.
This can be highly abused if not careful and there
is a &#64;depower to disable cloaking and/or dark that will
disable this.</p></li>
<li><p>immortals can optionally supercloak from even wizards.
this can not be disabled, and you must consider that immortals
should be treated as the God player (#1) since they are
effectively #1 in nearly every way.</p></li>

<p>The flexibility to customize RhostMUSH is what is most daunting.
Don’t fret, you don’t need to do it to run RhostMUSH successfully.
In fact, the default configuration is mostly compatible with
MUSH and will work correctly out of the box for most needs.  For those
wishing to play, of course the sky is the limit of what you want to
do.</p>
