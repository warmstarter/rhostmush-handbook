<h1><span class="section-number">18. </span>Historical Non-Disclosure Agreement</h1>
<p>The following NDA comes from the time when RhostMUSH was not publially
available. It is preserved here for historical reasons. We are suckers for
looking back at things. :)

<p>The Rhost developers would like to see what was added, and possibly
look at adding them to the main distro if we see others would like
it (with full credits to you), but we belive once you have the code,
you should be allowed to play with it fully as long as the first two
rules are kept.</p>
