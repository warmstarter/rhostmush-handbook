<h1>Dealing with DB Corruption</h1>
<p>Ok.  Your database won’t come up.</p>
<p>If you are reading this, then likely the scenerio is one of the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The mush says it can’t find your database files.</p></li>
<li><p>The mush says it can’t read or load your database files.</p></li>
<li><p>The mush seems to load fine but I can’t log in anyone and when I do
all the names and attributes of things seem to be gone!</p></li>
<li><p>Bringing up your mail database</p></li>
</ol>
<p>First thing is first.  Don’t have a panic attack.</p>
<div class="section" id="if-the-mush-says-it-can-t-find-your-database-files">
<h2>If the mush says it can’t find your database files</h2>
<div class="section" id="check-the-names-of-the-database-files-in-your-data-directory">
<h3>Check the names of the database files in your ‘data’ directory</h3>
<p>They should be named something like:
netrhost.db
netrhost.db.old
netrhost.db.old.prev
netrhost.gdbm.dir
netrhost.gdbm.pag</p>
<p>And you may see a netrhost.db.flat</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="check-your-netrhost-conf-file">
<h3>Check your netrhost.conf file</h3>
<p>If you never touched the <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>database or muddb_name params, you should be good.</p>
<p>Verify your <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">*</span></a>database params (and muddb_name) are still set to ‘netrhost’ as
part of the name.  Ergo, the default values and you didn’t change them.
These should match up with the filenames in your data directory.</p>
<p>If these names do not match up, it can’t find the database files to load.
So you shouldn’t have to change these names, ever. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="check-your-mush-config-file">
<h3>Check your mush.config file</h3>
<p>If you never modified this file, you should be good.</p>
<p>The gamename should be ‘netrhost’ for this file.  This does NOT control
the name of your game.  This controls the name of all the files
as associated to the mush.  So changing this means the netrhost.conf
file, all your database files, and so forth.  Please don’t change this :)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-the-mush-says-it-can-t-read-or-load-your-database-files">
<h2>If the mush says it can’t read or load your database files</h2>
<p>Double check everything for the previous issue. Make sure everything is named properly.</p>
<div class="section" id="verify-you-have-enough-disk-space-quota">
<h3>Verify you have enough disk space. (quota)</h3>
<p>Some account have a limited quota to run in.  If you reached or exceed
your disk quota, you can have a corrupted database.  So always keep
your eye on the size.  quota -s to see a human readable format to see
how much quota you have left.  You want to make sure current in use is
below the ‘grace’ and soft/hard limits shown.  If not, you’re out of
space.</p>
<p>You will need to remove some files before you repair and bring up your
mush again.  Try to keep your quota at least 200 megs free to allow
plenty of wonderful growth space for the mush.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="verify-you-have-enough-disk-space-system">
<h3>Verify you have enough disk space.  (system)</h3>
<p>The second way you can run out of disk space is by the filesystem itself.
do a df -h . in your ‘game’ directory’.  That is df -h &lt;period&gt;.
This will return how much disk space is being used and how much remains.
If it shows 100% used, you’re out of disk space and the db is corrupt.</p>
<p>At this point, you’re pretty screwed.  You can see if anything exists
in your system to free up some space, but if the filesystem itself
is filled, reach out to the owner of the server and let them know.
It’s a much bigger deal than just your mush if that’s the case.</p>
<p>Until this issue is resolved, you can not repair and bring up your mush.
No disk to run the game.</p>

<div class="section" id="if-the-mush-seems-to-load-fine-but-i-can-t-log-in-anyone-and-when-i-do-all-the-names-and-attributes-of-things-seem-to-be-gone">
<h2>If the mush seems to load fine but I can’t log in anyone and when I do all the names and attributes of things seem to be gone!</h2>
<p>Ok, at this point you likely had your mush up when the physical server
went down hard.  Weither through an emergency shutdown or a physical
power outage, your db likely was brought down hard during a write,
so it left it in a corrupt state.  These things happen.  This is
why we always strongly request you make daily flatfile dumps.</p>
<p>So, to recover your database.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-bad-news">
<h3>The bad news</h3>
<p>If you have no flatfile backup or never bothered with backups?
I’m sorry, at this point you’re SOA.  There’s no easy way to
recover a corrupted binary database.  If you absolutely need
data out of it we may be able to help you to piece meal things
out of it, but otherwise it’s a lost cause.  You’ll have to start
over from scratch.  I’m sorry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-good-news">
<h3>The good news</h3>
<p>If you made backups, or if the server had a normal shutdown, you
likely have a flatfile backup.  You will see a netrhost.db.flat
in either the ‘data’ directory or ‘prevflat’ directory.  That
is your manual flatfile backup.</p>
<p>If the server had a normal shutdown, you will see a file called
netrhost.db.TERMFLAT.  This is a scram-emergency db flatfile.
It attempts to write this at the time of server shutdown to
hopefully keep a clean backup in the case of issues since
it identifies the server is coming down hard.  Make sure
if you plan to use the TERMFLAT as your recovery flatfile
that the very last line shows something like ** END OF DUMP <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">**</span></a>.
That shows you had a successful backup.</p>
