            What RhostMUSH is about and what’s so great about RhostMUSH
        <paragraph>
            RhostMUSH was founded in 1989, originally by Natasha Davis (Nyctasia) and as
            a branch from the original release of TinyMUD code.  It was her desire to make
            a game that was flexible, with multiple levels of progression and highly
            customizeable.  She lost time and interest and passed the game to
            Steve Shivers (Seawolf), Mike McDermott (Thorin), and Jace Hoppel (Ashen-Shugar)
        <paragraph>
            Through their work, the stability improved, we fixed it to be multi-platform
            and as bug free as we could possibly make it.  We introduced several methods both
            in game and in source that allowed consistent memory bounds checking and
            various alerts for any mischievous naughtyness in-game or possibilities of any
            hacks, patches, or alterations in the code causing leaks or issues.
        <paragraph>
            While not perfect, it has allowed us to have an absolutely outstanding
            turn around for any bugs sent our way, which anyone who uses RhostMUSH will
            attest to.
        <paragraph>
            Over the years, others have joined the RhostMUSH team, including Ambrosia
            (who is the current dev lead), Lensman, Kage (who kindly provided the
            UTF8/unicode port), Jeff/Loki, Rook, Noltar, and Odin.
        <paragraph>
            We also have had hundreds of people who have offered (and provided) help,
            patches, suggestions, bug fixes, and alternations all on their own and
            every single one will have had their name mentioned in the RHOST.CHANGES
            file in the readme directory.  It’s far too large to have in the online
            help files.
        <paragraph>
            RhostMUSH today provides an amazing tool that allows nearly entire
            customization in-game of every single feature available in Rhost without
            having the requirement to modify the hardcode.  This includes but is
            not limited to:

                Recycle bin

                <paragraph>
                    Yup, you guessed it.  RhostMUSH has a windows like recycle bin.
                    This means the objects you @nuke and @destroy become ‘destroyed’
                    but not recycled until they are @purged.  If you use the Myrddin
                    CRON in the Mushcode directory, it by default sets up a job
                    to purge anything over 30 days old, which should be more than
                    sufficient for any needs.  The goodness of this?  You can recover
                    nuked things from any period of time, as long as they were not
                    @purged first.
                <paragraph>
                    Commands: @purge, @nuke, @destroy, @recover, @reclist
        <section ids="snapshot" names="@snapshot">

                <paragraph>
                    Live image snapshots to unload or load to and from
                    disk.  As many snapshots as you want, as often as you want.
                    It essentially does a flatfile dump of a dbref#.  Great for
                    backups or cross-Rhost portability.

                            override all locks.  There’s two flags to disable this.
                            NO_OVERRIDE to stop overriding all locks (including attribs)
                            and NO_USELOCK to just stop overriding uselocks.

                            This can be highly abused if not careful and there
                            is a @depower to disable cloaking and/or dark that will
                            disable this.

                            immortals can optionally supercloak from even wizards.
                            this can not be disabled, and you must consider that immortals
                            should be treated as the God player (#1) since they are
                            effectively #1 in nearly every way.

                The flexibility to customize RhostMUSH is what is most daunting.
                Don’t fret, you don’t need to do it to run RhostMUSH successfully.
                In fact, the default configuration is mostly compatible with
                MUSH and will work correctly out of the box for most needs.  For those
                wishing to play, of course the sky is the limit of what you want to
                do.

                                Debugging in Rhost allows for advanced features like expressing where and
                                when to do debugging via a trace() function, with toggled labels, and the
                                ability to grep content from trace output.  There also exists features to
                                color-match parenthesis, braces, and brackets in-game as well as pretty print
                                the output of commands and functions.

                                Zoning in Rhost allows the same functionality of Penn and MUX, though the
                                syntax is different.  It also allows the ability to belong to multiple
                                zones at the same time and take advantage of mulitple zones at once.
                                This allows for increased levels of complexity.

                                Functions and commands can both be overridden with softcode.  To
                                override a hardcoded command you first set the command ignore.
                                There are various levels of ignoring so that you could have it
                                ignored from mortals but have it executed fine for non-mortals.
                                This allows you to use the actual physical command within a
                                softcode override.  You may also use @Hook for altering how
                                a command works.   Functions are overridden by setting the
                                function in question ignored, then writing a softcode alternative
                                that is then executed and fetched appropriately.

                                Rhost has a recycle bin that works a bit like a windows recycle bin.
                                Whenever you destroy something within the mush, it is stacked onto
                                the recycle bin and marked unavailable within the mush.  This marks
                                the dbref# as garbage in any sense of the word.  However, the object
                                is not able to be reused until purged.  Once purged, it is put onto
                                a free list that can then be reassigned to a new object.

                                there is no risk of recursion.

                                This allows you to have unique uselocks per $command.  This is done
                                through the use of the USELOCK attribute flag, then you set up
                                a matching attribute name with a prefix of a ~ to specify how
                                the lock is to be evaluated.  This works in the same manner
                                as an evaluation lock.  To be able to use the USELOCK attribute flag
                                you must be empowered to do so with the ‘ATRUSE’ @toggle.  You may
                                also use the secure_atruselock config parameter to globally enable
                                this and not require the toggle to be set.

                                This is something that should be discussed by you and the staff
                                of your game.  As a good rule of thumb, only provide the bitlevel
                                that is required to do the job.  Too much power is always risky.
                                In essence, each tier of bit can do everything the previous bitlevel
                                can do, and then additional stuff on top of it.  The highest bitlevel
                                is #1 itself, being bitlevel 7.  Then immortal, which should be
                                considered the #1 character in most cases and is bitlevel 6.  Then
                                the royalty character, which is equal to wizard on penn, mux, or
                                other codebases.  For most things, this is the bitlevel you want
                                to assign players.  The exception will likely be game owners or
                                people who control the master room code.

                                Global attribute formatting is a method define a wrapper, of sorts,

                                can be processed through this.  All attributes will be either
                                &FORMAT<attribute> or &<attribute>FORMAT based on the current
                                configuration.  Example: &FORMATDESC or &DESCFORMAT localy, or
                                use the following global objects for global formatting.  Local
                                formatting has priority.

                                Clusters is the way to virtually assign multiple objects into
                                a single physical object.  It essentially chains together two
                                or more objects to share attributes between them, so that any
                                attribute set on any object in that cluster can be set or fetched
                                as if it was a singular entity.  This allows some amazing ability
                                to distribute attribute content or even have a farm of a massive
                                amount of attributes without paying a hefty penalty on object bloat.

                        IMMORTAL - They can do anything.  Treat this as #1 and only give to
                        people you trust.  Period.   You don’t have to use this bit
                        if you do not want to and just assume #1.
