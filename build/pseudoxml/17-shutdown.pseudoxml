                WARNING: Never kill -9 Rhost
            <paragraph>
                Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you kill -9 your mush unless you donâ€™t care for the
                database.  The reason is if the mush happens to be saving, in any method, to the
                database, especially a QDBM database, you will likely have just corrupted your
                database, so pull out a flatfile to recover.
            <paragraph>
                Sadly, this also may occur if the server hosting you takes a nose-dive in the middle
                of a db write.  Rhost can recover corruption in-game while up, but if it bombs
                in the middle of a write, all bets are off. :)
