<h1>What to type to configure and get your RhostMUSH up and running</h1>
<p>You may configure Rhost three ways.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-game-with-a-blank-database">
<h2>Creating a new game with a blank database</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Modify your ./game/netrhost.conf file or what settings you want.
Don’t feel overwhelmed, it’s all very well documented.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-game-with-ambrosia-s-default-database">
<h2>Creating a new game with Ambrosia’s default database</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Follow minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/IMPORTANT_README</p>
<p>The netrhost.conf file you will copy is in minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/game
Copy this netrhost.conf file into your ‘game’ directory.</p>
<p>You will want the custom txt files under Amb-MinimalRhost/txt in your game/txt
directory and to mkindx all the txt files.  You can run ./Startmush -i to index.</p>
<p>When ./Startmush prompts you to load a flatfile, say ‘yes’ and hit &lt;RETURN&gt;
to have it search for flatfiles, then select netrhost.db.flat from under
the minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost directory.</p>
<p>The main steps to make sure you do for Ambrosia’s db:
~/Server/minimal-DBs/Amb-MinimalRhost/netrhost.db.flat – Ambrosia’s secure and featured minimal db.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use the matching netrhost.conf file under the Amb-MinimalRhost/game directory</p></li>
<li><p>Load in the settings specified in the Amb-MinimalRhost/bin directory.
- Copy this file into your ~/Server/bin directory
- From ‘Server’ directory type: make clean
- From ‘Server’ directory type: make confsource and ‘l’oad option 0
- Specify any -additional- options you want at this point.
- Recompile your code</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the files in Amb-MinimalRhost/game/txt into your ~/Server/game/txt directory</p></li>
<li><p>from your ~/Server/game txt file run on each of the txt files:
../mkindx &lt;txtfile&gt;.txt &lt;txtfile&gt;.indx
Where &lt;txtfile&gt; is the name of the file (minus the .txt extension)</p></li>
<li><p>If running, &#64;reboot your game.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-game-with-the-generic-default-database">
<h2>Creating a new game with the generic default database</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Copy the netrhost.conf from minimal-DBs/minimal_db to your game directory.</p>
<p>When ./Startmush prompts you to load a flatfile, say ‘yes’ and hit &lt;RETURN&gt;
to have it search for flatfiles, then select netrhost.db.flat from under
the minimal-DBs/minimal_db directory.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="starting-your-mush">
<h2>Starting your MUSH</h2>
<p>Once you have used one of these three methods to obtaina database, you can start your mush up.
At this point type from the game directory:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>./Startmush</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="backups-for-rhostmush">
<h2>Backups for RhostMUSH</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Backups are already handled and integrated with a script ‘backup_flat.sh’.
If you wish to customize this, feel free.  Again, it is well documented and
just require changing settings at the top of this script.</p>
<p>By default, it does 7 contiguous backups.  You may increase or decrease
this value to any value you want.</p>
<p>It will, by default, backup all your txt/<em>.txt files, your netrhost.conf
file, your netrhost.db.flat (mush db) file, your RhostMUSH.dump.</em>
(mail db) files, your RhostMUSH.news.* (internal news/bbs db – if used),
your RhostMUSH.areg.* (the autoregistration db – if used), and any sqlite
database you currently may be using which are OPTIONALLY backed up if you
remove the ‘#’ from before it.</p>
<p>The backup script also will optionally rcp/scp, ftp, or mail any backups
you want to a remote destination.  Be forewarned, the backup files can
potentially get rather large for larger games, even compressed.  The
average size for these files will be 1-5MB.  It could potentially get
over 10-20MB in size for excessively large games, so plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Be aware that the backup system will NOT make successful backups if you
run out of disk space.  This includes actually running out of disk space
or running out of disk quota.  There is a mechanism inside the backup
script to specify an email address that you wish to get alerts from
in these instances.  I recommend using it.</p>
<p>If you make changes to your backup_flat.sh script with an already
active and running mush and wish to just restart the backup procedure
just issue: ./backup_restart.sh</p>
