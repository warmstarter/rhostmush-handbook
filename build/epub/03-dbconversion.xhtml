<h1>How to convert a database from another mush to RhostMUSH</h1>
<div class="section" id="converting-a-flatfile-database-for-use-in-rhostmush">
<h2>Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH</h2>
<p>In the ~/Server/convert directory there is a script called ‘doconvert.sh’</p>
<p>This script will convert most flatfiles from existing mush engines to
RhostMUSH.  The exception is PennMUSH 1.8.0 and later.  For this there is a
BETA converter penn18x_converter.tgz.  This is proven to work, most of the time,
with codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not been fully vetted with
the latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies.</p>
<p>To convert a non-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you first
need a valid flatfile of the game you’re wanting to convert.  Please refer
to the documentatation of the mush engine in question (MUX, Penn 1.7, TM2/3)
on how to do this.  Once you have it type:</p>
<p>./doconvert.sh FLATFILETOCONVERT FLATFILEOUTPUT</p>
<p>In this instance, FLATFILETOCONVERT will be the filename (with full path) to
the flatfile you are wishing to convert.</p>
<p>The FLATFILEOUTPUT is anyfilename you wish to name the RhostMUSH converted
flatfile.  I suggest netrhost_converted.db.flat so you know by the name
what it is.</p>
<p>Follow what it asks for and just let it do its thing.</p>
