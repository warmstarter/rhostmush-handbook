<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Minimum 1 GB (memory and swap combined) to compile (functions.c is huge)</p></li>
<li><p>Any Unix flavor should be fine.  Linux, BSD, Mac OSX, Solaris, Tru64, AIX, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>(BETA ONLY) cygwin under Windows.  It requires the entire base development set and Requirements below.</p></li>
<li><p>Disk:  100 MB or more (depending on size of db and how many backups you wish to maintain)</p></li>
<li><p>Memory: 12-100 MB (depending on size of mush and what size buffers you select and packages you include)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>RhostMUSH is a Linux or Unix based server software that runs as a daemon on the host.  In order to build this software, you will need the bare minimum of the ability to run ‘make’ commands.  Package requirements are as follows:
* glibc and gcc/clang (compiling the code)
* git (to clone the source and maintain patches)
* bash/ksh/dash (or compatible shell - for use with build menu)
* libcrypt (for password encryption - this is usually standard on unix based systems)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="optional-packages">
<h2>Optional Packages</h2>
<p>RhostMUSH also offers optional linking and library attachments.  For some of these libraries it will attempt to do auto-detection, but in a worse case scenario, there exists override hashes in the menu to disable options it thinks exist that do not.  Optional packages are as follows:
* openssl dev libraries/headers (for MUX password compatibility, and digest() and advanced cryptology functionality.
* mysql client &amp; mysql_config (required for mysql capabilities)
* sqlite3 libraries (required for sqlite capabilities)
* ruby/perl/python/etc (for custom interactive dynamic custom functions with the execscript() feature)
* libpcre (if you wish to use system pcre libraries instead of the built-in ones)</p>

<h2>Hosting Requirements</h2>
<p>You will need a stable host and access to open a single port number of your choice on the firewall.  Most games choose a number between 1025 and 9999, by convention.  Please make sure your debug_id matches the port number + 5.  So if your port is 1234, your debug_id will be 12345.  The debug_id is for use in the API daemon that runs Rhost as a container to keep track of heap, stack, and execution location.</p>
