<h1>Database</h1>
<div class="section" id="loading-an-existing-database">
<h2>Loading an existing Database</h2>
<p>To load in a previous database, you run the db_load script.</p>
<p>From the game directory you would type:</p>
<p>./db_load data/netrhost.gdbm yourflatfilehere data/netrhost.db.new</p>
<div class="section" id="then-you-just-follow-the-prompts-to-load-in-your-flatfile-there">
<h3>Then you just follow the prompts to load in your flatfile there.</h3>
<p>If you wish to have #1’s password reset to ‘Nyctasia’ please add this
to the bottom of your netrhost.conf file:</p>
<p>newpass_god 777</p>
<p>The caveat is that you must not have any netrhost.db* or netrhost.gdbm* files
in your data directory prior to loading it in.  It’ll error out if previous
files exist.  So you will need to move all files that start with netrhost.db*
and all files that start with netrhost.gdbm* to another directory.</p>
<p>Your flatfile tends to be named ‘netrhost.db.flat’ which is in your data
directory.  You can, however, name your flatfile anything you want and have
it in any directory you want.</p>
<p>To make a flatfile in game, you just issue &#64;dump/flat.  You can specify
a filename after it, otherwise it assumes the name ‘netrhost.db.flat’.</p>

<h2>Converting a flatfile database for use in RhostMUSH</h2>
<p>In the ~/Server/convert directory there is a script called ‘doconvert.sh’</p>
<p>This script will convert most flatfiles from existing mush engines to
RhostMUSH.  The exception is PennMUSH 1.8.0 and later.  For this there is a
BETA converter penn18x_converter.tgz.  This is proven to work, most of the time,
with codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not been fully vetted with
the latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies.</p>
<p>To convert a non-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you first
need a valid flatfile of the game you’re wanting to convert.  Please refer
to the documentatation of the mush engine in question (MUX, Penn 1.7, TM2/3)
on how to do this.  Once you have it type:</p>
<p>./doconvert.sh FLATFILETOCONVERT FLATFILEOUTPUT</p>
<p>In this instance, FLATFILETOCONVERT will be the filename (with full path) to
the flatfile you are wishing to convert.</p>
<p>The FLATFILEOUTPUT is anyfilename you wish to name the RhostMUSH converted
flatfile.  I suggest netrhost_converted.db.flat so you know by the name
what it is.</p>
<p>Follow what it asks for and just let it do its thing.</p>
