<h2><span class="section-number">9.1. </span>Signals and why you need them for control</h2>
<p>Rhost by default allows signals at the shell to handle various processes in-game.</p>
<p>The following signals are useful.</p>
<div class="section" id="term-kill-term-or-kill-15">
<h3><span class="section-number">9.1.1. </span>TERM (kill -TERM or kill -15)</h3>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>This will immediately terminate the mush, dumping a special flatfile called
netrhost.db.TERM and scramming the db in question by force-closing it
without any writes.  A TERM is the effort for the mush to shut down the
mush as fast as possible to avoid any db corruption if possible since
a TERM signal is common during a server shutdown, so time is paramount.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="usr1-kill-usr1">
<h3><span class="section-number">9.1.2. </span>USR1 (kill -USR1)</h3>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>This by default issues a reboot on the server.  This is a special parameter
because this can actually be changed in-game to do any number of other
things.  Please refer to the RhostMUSH running in question if this is
the default behavior or if the method for USR1 is doing something else.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="usr2-kill-usr2">
<h3><span class="section-number">9.1.3. </span>USR2 (kill -USR2)</h3>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>This will shutdown (cleanly) the mush.  This behaves as if you issued
a &#64;shutdown from within the game, and follows all proper procedure
in bringing the game down cleanly and safely.  This shoudl be used
when doing maintenance on the game or if you need to bring it down
from the shell.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kill-kill-kill-or-kill-9">
<h3><span class="section-number">9.1.4. </span>KILL (kill -KILL or kill -9)</h3>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>This signal can not be caught and will immediately terminate the game
without any safty to the database at all.  Short of something horribly
wrong going on, this should never be used to bring down your mush.
Doing so will almost certainly corrupt your databases (ALL OF THEM)
that are open, including but not limited to your main database, your
mail database, your autoregistration database, and so forth.  So if
you do this, plan to do some database recovery from your flat files.
Also, when you bring down a mush in this manner, you need to issue
Startmush -f to bring it back up.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="warning-never-kill-9-rhost">
<h3><span class="section-number">9.2.2. </span>WARNING: Never kill -9 Rhost</h3>
<p>Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you kill -9 your mush unless you don’t care for the
database.  The reason is if the mush happens to be saving, in any method, to the
database, especially a QDBM database, you will likely have just corrupted your
database, so pull out a flatfile to recover.</p>
<p>Sadly, this also may occur if the server hosting you takes a nose-dive in the middle
of a db write.  Rhost can recover corruption in-game while up, but if it bombs
in the middle of a write, all bets are off. :)</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="autoshutdown-script">
<h2><span class="section-number">9.3. </span>Autoshutdown script</h2>
<p>The makefile will ‘make’ the program that will STOP the mush.
Please tweek ‘autolog.h’ with the proper parameters.</p>
<p>The ‘startup.sh’ will START the mush.</p>
<p>Both of these are intended to be used for automations (automated processes)
like your rc.local file and/or startup scripts when you bring your server up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="network-port-redirector">
<h2><span class="section-number">9.4. </span>Network Port redirector</h2>
<p>This is a port redirector incase you decide to move your mush
to a new site/port.  To use, first, compile the code.  To do
this you would type the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>cc portmsg.c -o portmsg</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>if ‘cc’ is not defined, try the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>gcc portmsg.c -o portmsg</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Once compiled, you would then modify the file ‘file’ to describe
the mush, what was done, where it’s moved to, then specify the
IP address and the PORT where specified.</p>
<p>To launch the application, you would then type:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>./portmsg file &lt;port&gt;</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Where &lt;port&gt; is the port where the mush used to run at.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">9.5. </span>Using the built-in cron system for periodically running commands</h2>
<div class="section" id="syntax-for-rhost-cron">
<h3><span class="section-number">9.5.1. </span>Syntax for rhost.cron</h3>
<p>The rhost.cron file will be in the syntax as follows:</p>
<p>username (or dbref#)
command1;command2;command3;…;commandN
command
command
command1;command2;command3;…;commandN</p>
<p>You can have commands strung together with a semicolon
on the same line.  This counts as a single line of input.
You can have at most 20 lines of commands after the target
you wish to execute the commands as.  The target may
be a player name OR a dbref# of any valid dbref# within
the game.  Invalid targets will abort the cron process.
Non-printable characters in the cron file will abort
the process.  Any aborts or warnings will be logged
in the netrhost.gamelog.</p>
<p>Here is a working example of the code cron file.
This example will perform dumps of the mush.</p>

<div class="section" id="textfile-frequently-asked-questions">
<h3><span class="section-number">9.7.1. </span>Textfile Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>Q:  How do I put color in these files?
A1: Look at ansi.h and you need to put the literal ASCII codes.  They will look like: ^[[0m (for ANSI_NORMAL).  That’s &lt;ESC&gt;[
A2: You can enable ansi_txtfiles then use %c (or %x/%m) encoding for ansi, however you compiled your Rhost.</p>
<p>Q:  I want to design my own txt files to read in the mush.
A:  Easy.  Design them like help.txt would be set up, mkindx the file, then you can access it via &#64;dynhelp online.</p>
<p>Q:  Do I have to mkindx these files whenever I make changes?
A:  Only the ones that have ‘&amp; ‘ index. (help.txt, wizhelp.txt, news.txt, etc)</p>
<p>Q:  Do I have to &#64;readcache in the game whenever I make a change?
A:  Only when you modify any of the files listed in README.TXTFILES.  Not the ones you use with &#64;dynhelp.</p>
<p>Q:  Can’t I just make code in the mush that then is used for these silly txt files?
A:  Absolutely.  Check ‘wizhelp file_object’.</p>
