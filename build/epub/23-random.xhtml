<h1>Random notes and things to know about RhostMUSH</h1>

<h2>Note on bits, their levels, and things they do</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>IMMORTAL - They can do anything.  Treat this as #1 and only give to
people you trust.  Period.   You don’t have to use this bit
if you do not want to and just assume #1.</p>
<p>ROYALTY - Unlike PENN/MUX, this is <em>not</em> a sub-wizard, this is a
FULL wizard.  Plus, they can do a bit more.</p>
<p>COUNCILOR - Like royalty on PENN/MUX but they can modify.</p>
<p>ARCHITECT - Can’t do as much as councilor, but lot more than BUILDER.</p>
<p>GUILDMASTER - Very limited.  Sees dbrief#’s, can ex things their
level and lower and &#64;quota players.</p>

<h2>You need to &#64;pcreate your guest characters and set them GUEST</h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It doesn’t create them on the fly but we considered this better.
You have 31 total you can have.  It defaults to 10 in the
netrhost.conf file.  You can rename the guests anything you want,
but before you do so, you must add the dbref#’s to the param
guest_namelist</p>
