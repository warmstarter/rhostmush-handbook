msgid "RhostMUSH is a Linux or Unix based server software that runs as a daemon on the host.  In order to build this software, you will need the bare minimum of the ability to run 'make' commands.  Package requirements are as follows: * glibc and gcc/clang (compiling the code) * git (to clone the source and maintain patches) * bash/ksh/dash (or compatible shell - for use with build menu) * libcrypt (for password encryption - this is usually standard on unix based systems)"

msgid "RhostMUSH also offers optional linking and library attachments.  For some of these libraries it will attempt to do auto-detection, but in a worse case scenario, there exists override hashes in the menu to disable options it thinks exist that do not.  Optional packages are as follows: * openssl dev libraries/headers (for MUX password compatibility, and digest() and advanced cryptology functionality. * mysql client & mysql_config (required for mysql capabilities) * sqlite3 libraries (required for sqlite capabilities) * ruby/perl/python/etc (for custom interactive dynamic custom functions with the execscript() feature) * libpcre (if you wish to use system pcre libraries instead of the built-in ones)"

msgid "You will need a stable host and access to open a single port number of your choice on the firewall.  Most games choose a number between 1025 and 9999, by convention.  Please make sure your debug_id matches the port number + 5.  So if your port is 1234, your debug_id will be 12345.  The debug_id is for use in the API daemon that runs Rhost as a container to keep track of heap, stack, and execution location."
