So you will need to move all files that start with netrhost.db* and all files that start with netrhost.gdbm* to another directory."

This is proven to work, most of the time, with codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not been fully vetted with the latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies."

msgid "To convert a non-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you first need a valid flatfile of the game you're wanting to convert.  Please refer to the documentatation of the mush engine in question (MUX, Penn 1.7, TM2/3) on how to do this.  Once you have it type:::"

msgid "If you are converting from a Penn, TinyMUSH, or MUX database, make sure you drill down into the LBUF section and select, at minimum, 8K lbufs.  You likely want that anyway as it gives you far more room for attribute content storage."

#: ../../source/database.rst:77
msgid "You can go up to 32K safely.  While 64k is safe and does work, there are issues with networking and older routers that use a 32K TCP buffer size that can at times cut off the data as overflow resulting in output to the end-point players not receiving their data.  So it is strongly recommended not to go above 32K in lbuffer size."
