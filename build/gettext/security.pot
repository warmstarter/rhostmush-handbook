msgid "One thing to keep in mind is that RhostMUSH, unlike PennMUSH is not flag dependant on permission level, it's ownership based.  While setting a wizard flag on an object would work, it's not recommended and it is instead recommended to chown the object in question to a wizard (like your wizard holder character) Then the object must be set inherit to actually inherit the wizard."

Sadly, this also has false positives because some situations require a differentating MTU value such as briged network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or similar encapsulated network services.  However, this option has several settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies to downright forbidding them.  If you're being actively attacked, it may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection."
