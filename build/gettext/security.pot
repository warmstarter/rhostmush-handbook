msgid "GUEST    - This is your guest flag, it should only be set on guests WANDERER - the WANDERER flag is default on new players.  This flag disables all building abilitites of the player. NO_COMMAND - You can use this to stop a player from being able to connect without worrying about changing their password FUBAR      - As the flag states, it f*'s them up beind all recognition.  It essentially stops them from doing absolutely anything in the mush but pose and say.  Yes, it even disables the quit command. SLAVE      - Funny enough, slave allows anything but say and pose.  To ruin a troll's life, set both FUBAR and SLAVE and sit back and smile. NO_TEL     - The target can't teleport or be teleported NO_MOVE    - The target is locked at their location unable to move at all NO_WALL    - They do not see any @wall except a wizard @wall/no_prefix.  This has the bonus of snuffing db save messages. NO_POSSESS - Sometimes it's useful to grant a builder character to multiple players.  The NO_POSSESS flag makes it so that player can not be logged in more than 2 times. NO_MODIFY  - The target can not be modified (except by immortal/#1) NO_EXAMINE - The target can not be examined/decompiled (except by immortal/#1) STOP       - Once a matching $command is found on an object set STOP, it 'stops' trying to find other $command matches. NOSTOP     - If a target that is set STOP is also set NOSTOP, it will check the master room for a command and execute that as well if found. NO_PESTER  - Stops target from @pemit or whisper.  You may use @icmd as well. NO_OVERRIDE - Useful for immortals.  By default they override all locks, including attribute locks.  This makes it so an immortal's passing of locks will behave like a mortals NO_USELOCK  - This is like NO_OVERRIDE but only effects uselocks.  You likely want to set this on your immortal and wizard. NO_ANSINAME - stops a target from having an ansified name NO_CODE     - lock down advanced coding from a target SPAMMONITOR - stop a target from issuing more than 60 commands a minute. FREE        - Stop costing money for day to day processing of commands/building"
