msgid "Compile time options"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install.rst:134
msgid "One of the first steps of making a MUSH or really any computer program is to compile the source code. This takes what's basically text files full of code and turns them into a program you can run. Within that source code are a number of options to choose from, but any time you want to change one of them, you have to recompile the source code and then restart the MUSH."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install.rst:140
msgid "These choices are typically made through the ``confsource`` menu which you'll be seeing momentarily. There are some pretty big choices here from whether or not you want hardcoded +help and comsys, deciding between a more secure server and certtain powerful but potentially dangerous MUSHcode options, and then whether or not you want to be able to connect to a variety of external programs like databases, webservers, and even other programming languages."

These choices are mostly made through the ``netrhost.conf`` file. Whenever a MUSH starts up or gets rebooted, it's going to look to what's in that file. A few of those choices relate to further configuring the choices you made with ``confsource``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install.rst:157
msgid "The ``netrhost.conf`` file has some aesthetic options like what if anything it says when the database is being saved or whether or not your MUSH will allow ANSI color, both in general, but also in things like people's names. It has a lot of very esoteric options for tuning the performance and safety of your MUSH. It also is where you define things that connect to your database like your master room and guests. It let's you determine which powers your staff does or does not have, and it's also where you have an option to change the password for #1 should you forget it. There are ways to change some of these options from within the MUSH and even have those changes become new defaults that survive a reboot. One thing you set there that you definitely can't change from within the MUSH, is which port it runs on."

msgid "Starting database options"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install.rst:172
msgid "This last big choice is one that you probably are well aware of at least some of the things it allows for, mostly because the database is basically where everyone on a MUSH lives. Most of the choices you ever make about your MUSH will happen in the database and it's something that's basically always going to be changing in more ways than any one person could follow. No matter how vast the database of a MUSH gets, they all started somewhere, and that's the last big choice you have to make."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install.rst:180
msgid "Depending on how you look at it, there's somewhere between thousands of choices and two choices for a starting database. What I mean is that you have the choice of starting with a brand new database to populate, only a room (#0) and you (#1), even the Master Room is something you'd have to add to it. The other option is to import an existing database, though to choose that option you'd also have to have access to an existing database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install.rst:187
msgid "Besides the brand new database that can be made on-demand, RhostMUSH comes with two databases that you can use to get your start. One is called 'Minimal' and the other is called 'Ambrosia' after the lead RhostMUSH developed that made it. Despite the name, they're both fairly minimal, there's no grid in either, but what you get is a lot of pre-installed softcode and security, as well as a ``netrhost.conf``` file that has been tuned to work well with it. Even if you don't use those databases you can take ideas for the ``netrhost.conf`` file for tuning your MUSH or even use some RhostMUSH commands to import that softcode into your database."

In this chapter, what we'll be doing is using the default options for for ``confsource`` and ``netrhost.conf`` and a brand new database. Those options and that blank slate are necessary so that you have in front of you a working MUSH with only #0 and #1 and get shown the way of building it into whatever is your dream MUSH, and I know we all have one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install.rst:208
msgid "There will be a chance to make all those other choices later, in fact that will be happening very soon. There's a lot of very interesting choices that you can make with RhostMUSH, too many for anyone to ever be able to use them all. If you don't start with mastering the basics, you'll never end up knowing what are the most RhostMUSH options. I can't tell you what they are, it's truly something you have to discover on your own. Remember, you want to build your dream MUSH, not mine."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/install.rst:218
msgid "Unless you are intending to start with a brand new database, you must be aware of it's needs and expectations for the settings of ``confsource`` and ``netrhost.conf`` Starter databases tend to distribute with them config files of at least the options they expect set or not set during the process of configuring and compiling the server."
