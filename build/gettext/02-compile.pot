msgid "Make sure to keep QDBM selected as it's a much more stable database engine that does not have attribute limit restrictions like GDBM does."

msgid "If you are converting from a Penn, TinyMUSH, or MUX database, make sure you drill down into the LBUF section and select, at minimum, 8K lbufs.  You likely want that anyway as it gives you far more room for attribute content storage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/02-compile.rst:24
msgid "You can go up to 32K safely.  While 64k is safe and does work, there are issues with networking and older routers that use a 32K TCP buffer size that can at times cut off the data as overflow resulting in output to the end-point players not receiving their data.  So it is strongly recommended not to go above 32K in lbuffer size."

msgid "Go ahead and select 64 char attributes.  It allows you to have 64 characters for attribute names.  It's handy to have."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/02-compile.rst:39
msgid "If you plan to use 'make confsource' to recompile your source, you should first issue a 'make clean' before re-issuing a 'make confsource'.  'make confsource' remembers the last options you used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/02-compile.rst:43
msgid "A failure to issue 'make clean' prior to re-compiling with 'make confsource' or re-compiling with 'make source' can potentially leave stale object files which may cause unforseen issues when running code, including but not limited to random crashes.  Generally whenever recompiling it's good to always make clean first."

msgid "Note about Patching"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/02-compile.rst:52
msgid "There's two ways you can look to patch the source.  If you plan to run the RhostMUSH source from a git repository, then please use the git repo to constantly update your code.  If you knew enough to want to set up a git repo then we expect knowledge on how to keep source trees updated in the git repo to be used the same as any other source distribution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/02-compile.rst:58
msgid "If, however, you have no idea what a git repo even is, or have no inclination of using git to manage your RhostMUSH source, or just don't care one way or another, then you can use the included patch.sh routine (from under the Server directory) to patch your source at any time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/02-compile.rst:63
msgid "From the server directory just type: ./patch.sh"

#: ../../source/02-compile.rst:65
msgid "That will auto-compile your source, auto make all your header files and essentially keep everything up to date to the latest source. Once that's done, all you do from within the game is two commands:"
