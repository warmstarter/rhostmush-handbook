msgstr ""

#: ../../source/toggles.rst:8
msgid "Flags are pretty much exactly the same as any other mush.  It's a flag that you set or unset on a target which then enables/disables or alters something that target can do.  There's help on all the flags in help and wizhelp."

msgid "Toggles"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/toggles.rst:16
msgid "Toggles were designed as a single point flag that immediately enables or disables a set ability or condition, thus a 'toggle'.  It works exactly like a flag and was originally designed for two reasons.  To distinguish from the multi-meaning of a 'flag', and because frankly we ran out of flag space :)"

msgid "@power"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/toggles.rst:25
msgid "A power is similar to a power on other mushes, but unlike them, our powers are multi-tier.  This means that they can be customized to empower something at a given bitlevel.  You may empower something from guildmaster up to councilor level.  There are some powers with a power level of N/A meaning they are a toggle power granting an absolute power level as specified in the help for that power. This requires the INHERIT flag for non-players to inherit powers, however, a specific object can be granted a power as well."

#: ../../source/toggles.rst:37
msgid "This is the anti-thesis of @power.  Also, depowers do not require inheritance.  They also have priority over flags, toggles, and powers.  You can use depower to remove or lower abilities and control from a target, even a full wizard (royalty) can be depowered."
