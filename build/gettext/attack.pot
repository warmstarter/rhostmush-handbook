msgid "Wizards in RhostMUSH by default override all locks and have a unique ability called 'wizcloaking'. If a wizard is set DARK and UNFINDABLE then they become cloaked (like a Romulan bird of pray) and will be undetectable by any means except by another wizard. Immortals have a super-cloak ability that makes them invisible to Wizards in addition. As shown above, there is a @depower to disable cloaking if it's abused."

msgid "ABOUT IMMORTALS: Immortals treat as #1. Seriously. They can do anything and everything. They have commands at their fingertips to literally hack and edit the database live, and naturally if they don't know what they're doing, can crash the mush, because of all this raw editing capabilities. Only set Immortal those who absolutely need it or you absolutely trust. Head coders, for example, should likely have an Immortal bit. Also, Immortals by default override pretty much every restriction in the game. A player set NO_TEL? Um yea, immortal can still @teleport them. This is intentional, because it's assumed Immortal's code should just work. So keep that in mind while coding. Cheers."
