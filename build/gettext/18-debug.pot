msgid "This will directly impact the function_recursion_limit from being set above 100.  If, for whatever reason, you really must have a ridiculously high recursion limit, then it is a suggestion to manually modify the stack limit in debug.h to a higher number."

msgid "We have reasonably set it to 10000 without too much issue, but keep in mind, the overhead is higher for every stack you throw on the process table.  Higher stack means more memory used."
