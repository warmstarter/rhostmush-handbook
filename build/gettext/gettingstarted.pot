msgid "The Comsystem and +bboard are owned by BC-Admin-Architect, which means that higher bitlevels might not be able to use those systems if they hide and set themselves DARK. This is intentional. The Architect bitlevel is enough to freely set attributes on players, so these systems did not need anything higher, and it prioritizes Councilor+ as mere mainenance-duty bitlevels. Even the MU* Head should log on as an Architect for everyday things."

msgid "The Comsystem and BBOARD have been modified to be configurable by Architect and higher. Both systems have a CANUSE attribute with the according code on them. Note that if you want both systems to be only configurable by Councilor+, that instead of @chowning them to a Councilor after changing those attribute for Councilor or higher, I suggest to simply @set the bboard and comsystem core objects NO_MODIFY instead, keeping them at Architect-power but making them unmodifyable by Architects."
