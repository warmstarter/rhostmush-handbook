msgid "@admin proxy_checker (please see wizhelp) This little doodad uses MTU checking against packet size which will detect most methods of proxies.  Sadly, this also has false positives because some situations require a differentating MTU value such as briged network connect with things like cloud services, docker, or similar encapsulated network services.  However, this option has several settings from just monitoring/alerting of possible proxies to downright forbidding them.  If you're being actively attacked, it may be worth considering adding this to add additional protection."
