It\u2019s a flag\nthat you set or unset on a target which then enables/disables or\nalters something that target can do.  There\u2019s help on all the flags\nin help and wizhelp.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"toggles\">\n<h2>Toggles<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#toggles\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>Toggles were designed as a single point flag that immediately enables\nor disables a set ability or condition, thus a \u2018toggle\u2019.  It works\nexactly like a flag and was originally designed for two reasons.  To\ndistinguish from the multi-meaning of a \u2018flag\u2019, and because frankly\nwe ran out of flag space :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"power\">\n<h2>&#64;power<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#power\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>A power is similar to a power on other mushes, but unlike them, our\npowers are multi-tier.  This means that they can be customized to\nempower something at a given bitlevel.  You may empower something\nfrom guildmaster up to councilor level.  There are some powers\nwith a power level of N/A meaning they are a toggle power granting\nan absolute power level as specified in the help for that power.\nThis requires the INHERIT flag for non-players to inherit powers,\nhowever, a specific object can be granted a power as well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"depower\">\n<h2>&#64;depower<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#depower\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>This is the anti-thesis of &#64;power.  Also, depowers do not require\ninheritance.  They also have priority over flags, toggles, and\npowers.  You can use depower to remove or lower abilities and\ncontrol from a target, even a full wizard (royalty) can be\ndepowered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "metatags": "", "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["08-lockdown", "Extended lockdown of the mush and considerations.", "N", "next"], ["06-security", "Considerations to locking down restrictions in RhostMUSH", "P", "previous"]], "sourcename": "07-toggles.rst.txt", "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">What FLAGS, TOGGLES, POWERS, and DEPOWERS mean in RhostMUSH</a><ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#flags\">Flags</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#toggles\">Toggles</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#power\">&#64;power</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#depower\">&#64;depower</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "display_toc": true, "page_source_suffix": ".rst", "current_page_name": "07-toggles", "sidebars": ["localtoc.html", "relations.html", "sourcelink.html", "searchbox.html"], "customsidebar": null, "alabaster_version": "0.7.12", "insegel_version": "1.1.0"}
