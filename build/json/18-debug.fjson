If, for whatever reason, you really must have\na ridiculously high recursion limit, then it is a suggestion to\nmanually modify the stack limit in debug.h to a higher number.</p>\n<p>We have reasonably set it to 10000 without too much issue, but keep\nin mind, the overhead is higher for every stack you throw on the\nprocess table.  Higher stack means more memory used.</p>\n<p>Also be aware that your shell stack limit directly is affected\nto this value.</p>\n<p>Type: ulimit -a</p>\n<p>This will show you your shell stack limits.  Do NOT set the\nSTACKMAX value higher than your shell\u2019s stack value.</p>\n<p>The value in ~/Rhost/Server/hdrs/debug.h is currently set as:</p>\n<p>#define STACKMAX 1000</p>\n<p>Feel free to change this to a higher value if you wish.</p>\n<p>The caveat.
