The exception is PennMUSH 1.8.0 and later.  For this there is a\nBETA converter penn18x_converter.tgz.  This is proven to work, most of the time,\nwith codebases between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2.  It has not been fully vetted with\nthe latest PennMUSH databases.  Our apologies.</p>\n<p>To convert a non-pennmush game (or a pennmush 1.7.4 or earlier), you first\nneed a valid flatfile of the game you're wanting to convert.  Please refer\nto the documentatation of the mush engine in question (MUX, Penn 1.7, TM2/3)\non how to do this.  Once you have it type::</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-default notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"o\">./</span><span class=\"n\">doconvert</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">sh</span> <span class=\"n\">FLATFILETOCONVERT</span> <span class=\"n\">FLATFILEOUTPUT</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>In this instance, FLATFILETOCONVERT will be the filename (with full path) to\nthe flatfile you are wishing to convert.</p>\n<p>The FLATFILEOUTPUT is anyfilename you wish to name the RhostMUSH converted\nflatfile.  I suggest netrhost_converted.db.flat so you know by the name\nwhat it is.</p>\n<p>Follow what it asks for and just let it do its thing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"note-about-compiling\">\n<h2><span class=\"section-number\">8.3. </span>Note about Compiling<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#note-about-compiling\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>If you are importing a MUX2 flatfile, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that you select\nmux passwords as a compatibility option, or you will NOT BE ABLE to log in\nto players as the password will not be recognizeable.</p>\n<p>Make sure to keep QDBM selected as it's a much more stable database engine\nthat does not have attribute limit restrictions like GDBM does.</p>\n<p>If you are converting from a Penn, TinyMUSH, or MUX database, make sure you\ndrill down into the LBUF section and select, at minimum, 8K lbufs.  You likely\nwant that anyway as it gives you far more room for attribute content storage.</p>\n<p>You can go up to 32K safely.  While 64k is safe and does work, there are issues\nwith networking and older routers that use a 32K TCP buffer size that can\nat times cut off the data as overflow resulting in output to the end-point\nplayers not receiving their data.  So it is strongly recommended not to go\nabove 32K in lbuffer size.</p>\n<p>Go ahead and select 64 char attributes.  It allows you to have 64 characters\nfor attribute names.  It's handy to have.</p>\n<p>If you wish at this point to set up mysql and/or sqlite, you  may do so.\nYes, you can use them in parallel without any issue.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "metatags": "", "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["gettingstarted", "<span class=\"section-number\">9. </span>Getting Started", "N", "next"], ["comparison", "<span class=\"section-number\">7. </span>Comparison of modern MUSH servers", "P", "previous"]], "sourcename": "database.rst.txt", "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">8.
