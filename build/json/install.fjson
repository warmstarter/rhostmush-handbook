No matter which\nchoices you ultimately make, there are certain things you will need to know how\nto do. This chapter is going to walk you through making the simplest possible\nversion of RhostMUSH. It's going to show you the things you would have to do\nno matter which choices you were making.</p>\n<p>In the process of making that simplest possible RhostMUSH you'll also learn\nwhat the basics of those choices are and when and how you would make them.\nLater chapters will get much more into all of those choices, but they will also\nassume you know everything in this chapter already, or at least have it as a\nhandy point of reference.</p>\n<p>While there are lots of little options, there are three big areas where you\nmake those choices.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"compile-time-options\">\n<h3><span class=\"section-number\">2.2.1. </span>Compile time options<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#compile-time-options\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h3>\n<p>One of the first steps of making a MUSH or really any computer program is\nto compile the source code. This takes what's basically text files full of code\nand turns them into a program you can run. Within that source code are a\nnumber of options to choose from, but any time you want to change one of them,\nyou have to recompile the source code and then restart the MUSH.</p>\n<p>These choices are typically made through the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">confsource</span></code> menu which you'll\nbe seeing momentarily. There are some pretty big choices here from whether or\nnot you want hardcoded +help and comsys, deciding between a more secure server\nand certtain powerful but potentially dangerous MUSHcode options, and then\nwhether or not you want to be able to connect to a variety of external programs\nlike databases, webservers, and even other programming languages.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"configuration-file-options\">\n<h3><span class=\"section-number\">2.2.2. </span>Configuration file options<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#configuration-file-options\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h3>\n<p>While there are some options in RhostMUSH that can only be changed through\nrecompiling the source code, there are way more options that can be changed\nwithout having to recompile. These choices are mostly made through the\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">netrhost.conf</span></code> file. Whenever a MUSH starts up or gets rebooted, it's\ngoing to look to what's in that file. A few of those choices relate to\nfurther configuring the choices you made with <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">confsource</span></code></p>\n<p>The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">netrhost.conf</span></code> file has some aesthetic options like what if anything\nit says when the database is being saved or whether or not your MUSH will\nallow ANSI color, both in general, but also in things like people's names.\nIt has a lot of very esoteric options for tuning the performance and safety\nof your MUSH. It also is where you define things that connect to your database\nlike your master room and guests. It let's you determine which powers your\nstaff does or does not have, and it's also where you have an option to change\nthe password for #1 should you forget it. There are ways to change some of\nthese options from within the MUSH and even have those changes become new\ndefaults that survive a reboot. One thing you set there that you definitely\ncan't change from within the MUSH, is which port it runs on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"starting-database-options\">\n<h3><span class=\"section-number\">2.2.3. </span>Starting database options<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#starting-database-options\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h3>\n<p>This last big choice is one that you probably are well aware of at least some\nof the things it allows for, mostly because the database is basically where\neveryone on a MUSH lives. Most of the choices you ever make about your MUSH\nwill happen in the database and it's something that's basically always going\nto be changing in more ways than any one person could follow. No matter how\nvast the database of a MUSH gets, they all started somewhere, and that's the\nlast big choice you have to make.</p>\n<p>Depending on how you look at it, there's somewhere between thousands of choices\nand two choices for a starting database. What I mean is that you have the\nchoice of starting with a brand new database to populate, only a room (#0) and\nyou (#1), even the Master Room is something you'd have to add to it. The other\noption is to import an existing database, though to choose that option you'd\nalso have to have access to an existing database.</p>\n<p>Besides the brand new database that can be made on-demand, RhostMUSH comes with\ntwo databases that you can use to get your start. One is called 'Minimal' and\nthe other is called 'Ambrosia' after the lead RhostMUSH developed that made it.\nDespite the name, they're both fairly minimal, there's no grid in either, but\nwhat you get is a lot of pre-installed softcode and security, as well as a\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">netrhost.conf`</span></code> file that has been tuned to work well with it. Even if you\ndon't use those databases you can take ideas for the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">netrhost.conf</span></code> file for\ntuning your MUSH or even use some RhostMUSH commands to import that softcode\ninto your database.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-choices-we-make\">\n<h3><span class=\"section-number\">2.2.4. </span>The Choices We Make<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-choices-we-make\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h3>\n<p>Well, not you're aware of those three big choices, what they are, and where\nyou'll run across them. Later in this Handbook we'll be going through those\nchoices in-depth. In this chapter, what we'll be doing is using the default\noptions for for <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">confsource</span></code> and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">netrhost.conf</span></code> and a brand new database.\nThose options and that blank slate are necessary so that you have in front of\nyou a working MUSH with only #0 and #1 and get shown the way of building it\ninto whatever is your dream MUSH, and I know we all have one.</p>\n<p>There will be a chance to make all those other choices later, in fact that\nwill be happening very soon. There's a lot of very interesting choices that\nyou can make with RhostMUSH, too many for anyone to ever be able to use them\nall. If you don't start with mastering the basics, you'll never end up knowing\nwhat are the most RhostMUSH options. I can't tell you what they are, it's truly\nsomething you have to discover on your own. Remember, you want to build your\ndream MUSH, not mine.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>\n<p>Unless you are intending to start with a brand new database, you must be\naware of it's needs and expectations for the settings of <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">confsource</span></code> and\n<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">netrhost.conf</span></code> Starter databases tend to distribute with them config\nfiles of at least the options they expect set or not set during the process\nof configuring and compiling the server.</p>\n<p>Knowing which database you intend to use is the first choice made of these\ninitial major configuration options, but that last that is made part of the\nMUSH.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"compiling-rhostmush\">\n<span id=\"id2\"></span><h2><span class=\"section-number\">2.3. </span>Compiling RhostMush<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#compiling-rhostmush\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"setup-directory-permissions\">\n<h3><span class=\"section-number\">2.3.1. </span>Setup directory permissions<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#setup-directory-permissions\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h3>\n<p>In order to both compile and run, all of the RhostMUSH files and directories\nneed to have the proper permissions set.
