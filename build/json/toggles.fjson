It's a flag\nthat you set or unset on a target which then enables/disables or\nalters something that target can do.  There's help on all the flags\nin help and wizhelp.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"what-are-toggles\">\n<h2><span class=\"section-number\">8.2. </span>What are Toggles?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-are-toggles\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>Toggles were designed as a single point flag that immediately enables\nor disables a set ability or condition, thus a 'toggle'.  It works\nexactly like a flag and was originally designed for two reasons.  To\ndistinguish from the multi-meaning of a 'flag', and because frankly\nwe ran out of flag space :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"what-is-an-power\">\n<h2><span class=\"section-number\">8.3. </span>What is an &#64;power?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-is-an-power\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>A power is similar to a power on other mushes, but unlike them, our\npowers are multi-tier.  This means that they can be customized to\nempower something at a given bitlevel.  You may empower something\nfrom guildmaster up to councilor level.  There are some powers\nwith a power level of N/A meaning they are a toggle power granting\nan absolute power level as specified in the help for that power.\nThis requires the INHERIT flag for non-players to inherit powers,\nhowever, a specific object can be granted a power as well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"what-is-an-depower\">\n<h2><span class=\"section-number\">8.4. </span>What is an &#64;depower?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-is-an-depower\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>This is the anti-thesis of &#64;power.  Also, depowers do not require\ninheritance.  They also have priority over flags, toggles, and\npowers.  You can use depower to remove or lower abilities and\ncontrol from a target, even a full wizard (royalty) can be\ndepowered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n", "metatags": "", "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["security", "<span class=\"section-number\">9. </span>Security", "N", "next"], ["bitlevels", "<span class=\"section-number\">7. </span>Multi-tiered bitlevel systems", "P", "previous"]], "sourcename": "toggles.rst.txt", "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">8.
