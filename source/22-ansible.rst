Installing using an ansible playbook
------------------------------------

To begin, you will run the following command in a directory that will house your game:

   > **git clone https://github.com/RhostMUSH/trunk Rhost**

You may also just run the yml file and ansible (ansible-playbook) to install your RhostMUSH engine
   > **wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RhostMUSH/trunk/master/rhostinstall.yml**

   > **ansible-playbook rhostinstall.yml**

This downloads the latest stable version of the code, bringing with it all patches and scripts, documentation and support tools that you will need.
